By this petition, the petitioner has prayed for quashing and setting aside the order dated 25th April 2017 passed by the respondent No.2­ the Scheduled   Tribe   Certificate   Scrutiny   Committee   (Scrutiny   Committee) whereby   the   claim   of   the   petitioner   of   belonging   to   Koli­Mahadev, Scheduled Tribe has been invalidated. 3. The petitioner has averred that despite several close relatives of the petitioner   having   been   declared   to   be   belonging   to   Koli­Mahadev, Scheduled Tribe, the respondent No.2­Scrutiny Committee has not taken into consideration the documents as well as the validity certificates issued in favour of the near blood relatives of the petitioner, including the real brother   of   the   petitioner.   The   petitioner   has   further   asserted   that   the Scrutiny Committee has simply brushed aside the documents and validity certificates, which amply show that the petitioner belongs to Koli­Mahadev, scheduled tribe. The respondent No.2­Scrutiny Committee has held that the petitioner has not succeeded in establishing the cultural affinity to the Koli­ Mahadeo, scheduled tribe. On this premise, the claim of the petitioner was unjustifiably negatived. 4. By an order dated 24th January 2019, after we had heard the matter for some time, we had granted two weeks time to respondent Nos.1, 2 and 4, by way of last chance, to file the affidavit in reply. It was further made Shraddha Talekar PS 2/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 13/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:31:37   ::: 3 952.wp.5977.2017.doc clear  that   if  no reply  is   filed within two weeks,   the Court  will  proceed further  with   the  hearing of   the  petition  taking allegations  made  in   the petition to be uncontroverted. However, respondent Nos. 1, 2 and 4 have not   filed   any   reply.   Shri   Rajpurohit,   the   learned   AGP   submitted   that respondent No.2 could not file the reply as the relevant documents could not be traced.  5. We find that sufficient opportunity was given to the respondents to file   reply  and  offer   justification   for   the   impugned  order  passed  by   the respondent No.2. Even otherwise, on perusal of the impugned order, we have   noticed   that   respondent   No.2   could   not   be   in   a   position   to   add anything more than the reasons, as recorded in the impugned order itself.  6. The observations in paragraph 9 of the impugned order indicate that the   respondent   No.2­Scrutiny   Committee   proceeded   on   an   incorrect premise  that   the  petitioner  has  failed to  prove his  case on  the basis  of cultural affinity, and that the 'affinity test' was the only basis on which the claim for the validity was to be adjudicated. The Scrutiny Committee has not assigned any justifiable reason as to why due weightage was not given to the voluminous documents and validity certificates of the near relatives of the petitioner, including the real brother of the petitioner. Shraddha Talekar PS 3/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 13/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:31:37   ::: 4 952.wp.5977.2017.doc 7. From the perusal of the record, it appears that a validity certificate was issued to the real brother of the petitioner­Saybanna Nagnath Kamale on 11th  July 2004. There are validity certificates of other relatives of the petitioner   also,   on   record.   By   now,   it   is   well   recognised   that   pre­ constitutional   documents   are   required   to   be   given   due   weight   in ascertaining   the   validity   of   the   caste   claim.   The   affinity   test,   though relevant, cannot be the only and 'litmus' test for determining the validity of the claim. In this context, a useful reference can be made to the judgment of Supreme Court in the case of  Anand Vs. Committee for Scrutiny & Verification of Tribe Claims & Ors.1 8. We have noticed that the Scrutiny Committees lightly brush aside the validity certificates issued in favour of the near relatives of the claimant, like parents, siblings and other paternal relatives, without any justifiable reason for discarding such documents on the premise that the claimant has failed to show affinity to the scheduled caste or tribe. This Court has time and again observed that the said approach of the Scrutiny Committee is not justifiable and even contemptuous.  In the case of   Apoorva d/o. Vinay Nichale Vs. Divisional Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee & Ors. 2,  this Court has observed as under :­ “9 ….................. In the circumstances, we are of the view that 1 (2012) 1 SCC 113 2 2010 Mh.L.J. 401 Shraddha Talekar PS 4/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 13/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:31:37   ::: 5 952.wp.5977.2017.doc the committee which has expressed a doubt about the validity of caste claim of the petitioner and has described it as a mistake in its order,  ought  not   to  have  arrived  at   a  different   conclusion.  The matters pertaining to validity of caste have a great impact on the candidate as  well  as on the  future generations  in many matters varying from marriage to education and enjoyment, and therefore where a committee has given a finding about the validity of the caste  of  a   candidate  another   committee  ought  not   to   refuse   the same status to a blood relative who applies. A merely different view on the same facts would not entitle the committee dealing with the subsequent caste claim to reject it. There is, however, no doubt as observed by us earlier that if a committee is of the view that the earlier  certificate  is  obtained by fraud it  would not be bound to follow the earlier caste validity certificate and is entitled to refuse the   caste   claim   and   also   in   addition   initiate   proceedings   for cancellation of the earlier order. …...........” 9. In the instant case, we find that the Committee has fallen into similar and familiar error.  10. The   learned   AGP   attempted   to   justify   the   impugned   order   by drawing our attention to the observations of  the Scrutiny Committee  in paragraph  3,  wherein,     the  Scrutiny  Committee  had  noted   that   certain relatives   of   the   petitioner   were   belonging   to   castes   like   Hindu   Talvar, Hindu Koli­Mahadeo, Hindu Mahadeo­Koli etc. More than 100 relatives of the   petitioner   were   arrayed   therein   and   thereafter   the   aforesaid observation   was   made.     This   approach   of   respondent   No.2­Scrutiny Committee is not at all commendable. Such generalisation indicates that the   Committee   approached   the   question   from   a   wrong   premise   and misdirected   itself   in   drawing   a   totally   unjustifiable   and   unwarranted Shraddha Talekar PS 5/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 13/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:31:37   ::: 6 952.wp.5977.2017.doc conclusion.  When the near relatives of  the petitioner,   including his  real brother,  were  declared   to   be   the  members   of  Koli­Mahadeo,   scheduled tribe,   the   claim   of   the   petitioner   could   not   have   been   discarded   with reference to the tribe/caste of persons with whom the petitioner had no blood relationship. 11. In   these  circumstances,  we   find   that   the  Scrutiny  Committee  has erred in invalidating the claim of the petitioner. In this view of the matter, we   are   inclined   to   interfere   with   the   order   passed   by   the   Scrutiny Committee. The petition, therefore, deserves to be allowed.  12.  The petition is allowed. The impugned order passed by respondent No.2­Scrutiny Committee dated 25th  April  2017 stands  quashed and set aside.     Respondent   No.2­   Scrutiny   Committee   is   directed   to   issue   the validity   certificate   to   the   petitioner   of   Koli­Mahadeo,   Scheduled   Tribe, within a period of three weeks from the date of the communication of this order. 13. In the circumstances, there shall be no order as to costs. [ N.J. JAMADAR, J. ]            [ B.R.

Pawar, learned AGP for respondent Nos.1 to 3 and Mr. N.P. Deshpande, learned counsel for respondent No.4.  2] Rule in each of the petitions.

The petitioners have also :::   Uploaded on   - 14/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:27   ::: DSS 3/12  j-cwp-13464,13476-13477-17.doc tendered applications to the Sub­Divisional Officer, Special Land Acquisition Officer/Collector as well as Acquiring Body requesting them to determine the amount of rental compensation and pay the same to the petitioners. It is further pointed out that though the applications are tendered to the Special Land Acquisition Officer as well as the Acquiring Body, there is no determination of the amount of rental compensation and as such, the petitioners are deprived of the monetary benefits.  6] In  the aforesaid circumstances,  all   these petitions can be disposed  of   by   issuing  directions   to   the  District  Collector   that District   Collector   himself   or   through   his   sub­ordinate   Officers either Sub­Divisional Officer or Special Land Acquisition Officer to determine   the   amount   of   rental   compensation   with   further directions to the Acquiring Body as well as the Collector to pay the amount   so   determined   to   the   petitioners   within   specified   time period.  7] The State Government has formulated policy  in respect of payment of rental compensation to the claimants in such of those :::   Uploaded on   - 14/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:27   ::: DSS 4/12  j-cwp-13464,13476-13477-17.doc cases   where   the   landed   properties   have   been   taken   over   in possession   prior   to   initiation   of   proceeding   under   the   Land Acquisition Act.  Under the G.Rs. dated 1st December 1972 and 2nd April 1979, the State has provided for the Scheme for payment of rental compensation at the rate of 6.5% of the final award value in respect   of   both   non­agricultural   and   agricultural   lands.   The amount of rental compensation has been enhanced to 8% in view of  G.R.  dated 2nd  April  1979.  In the matter of  Maimune Banu Hamidali  Khan  and  ors.   Vs.  State  and  others   –   2001   (3) Bom.C.R.   529,   the   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   upheld entitlement  of   such of   those  claimants  whose   lands  have  been taken over in possession by the Acquiring Body or the State prior to   initiation   of   proceeding   under   the   Land   Acquisition   Act   to receive   rental   compensation   at   the   rate  prescribed  under  G.R. dated 24th March 1988 and, it was further directed to release the amount as expeditiously as possible. The matter was carried to the Hon'ble Supreme Court by the State and the Hon'ble Supreme Court   in   the   matter   of  State   of   Maharashtra   and   ors   vs. Maimune   Banu   and   others   –   2003   (4)   Mh.L.J.   (SC)   727 :::   Uploaded on   - 14/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:27   ::: DSS 5/12  j-cwp-13464,13476-13477-17.doc confirmed the order passed by the High Court. In paragraph 9 of the judgment, the Hon'ble Supreme Court has observed thus:   “There   is   no   difficulty   and   we   find   none   as   to   why   the compensation on the basis of value determined by the Land Acquisition Officer cannot be paid. If there is upward revision of the amount, the consequences will follow and if necessary re­determination of the rental compensation can be made and after adjustment of the amount paid, if any, balance can be paid.   If   however   the   Land   Acquisition   Officer's   award   is maintained then nothing further may be required to be done. In   either   event,   payment   of   the   rental   compensation expeditiously would be an appropriate step”.     8] In the matter of  Bhagwat Nathu Patil vs. The State of Maharashtra   and   others   ­   2009   (3)   Mh.L.J.   413  while considering   the   request   of   petitioners   for   payment   of   rental compensation the Division Bench of   this Court referring to the judgment of Maimune Banu (supra) and other judgments including the   judgment   in   the  matter  of  Dinkar Sandipan Gholve and others   vs.   The   State   of   Maharashtra   and   others   (Writ Petition   No.   2559/2008   decided   on   24­7­2008)  observed   in paragraph Nos. 9 and 13 of the judgment thus: “9. –­­­­­­­­In   the   same  Judgment,  where  possession   was taken before initiation of proceedings under Section 4 of the Land Acquisition act, the Supreme Court has held that land :::   Uploaded on   - 14/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:27   ::: DSS 6/12  j-cwp-13464,13476-13477-17.doc owners are not entitled to the benefit under section 23(1A), between   the   date   of   possession   and   publication   of notification nor are they entitled to the interest  in terms of section 34 of the Act. Thus, a land owner whose land has been  taken  in  possession without   initiation  of  proceedings under the Land Acquisition Act, is denied interest in terms of Section 34 of the Act, though they cease to be in possession of the land having surrendered the land by virtue of private negotiations between the parties and promise held out by the State Government that for such dispossession, they would be paid   rental   compensation   in   terms   of   the   Government Resolutions. 13. Even   if   it   is   to  be   read   that   there   is  a  departure   in Government Resolution of 26/12/2003,  in our opinion,  the respondent State and/or acquiring body, would be bound by the  promises  made  and which  were  held  out   to   the   land owner,   who   surrendered   possession   of   his   land   on   the express   understanding   that   he   would   be   paid   rental compensation   in   terms   of   the   Government   Resolutions   as they stood at   the  time possession was taken.  Question of payment of rental compensation would not arise in the cases wherein  possession   is   taken  after  26/12/2003,   except   in those   cases   covered   by   Government   Resolution   dated 17/10/2003. If possession is taken after 26/12/2003, the rental   compensation   would   be   payable   in   terms   of Government  Resolution dated 26/12/2003.   If  a  party  has acted on a promise by the State to his detriment, the State would be bound to be held by its promise. The doctrine of promissory  estoppel  and  the  principle   thereto  has  evolved over a period of time in this Country.",

DATE     :­  31 JANUARY, 2019 JUDGMENT (PER : SARANG V. KOTWAL, J.) :­ 1. This is a Family Court Appeal preferred by the Appellant against   the  order  dated  21/09/2018 passed  by   the   learned Judge, Family   Court   No.6,   Mumbai,   in   Petition   No.B­57   of   2017.     This URS                                                                                                                                                                        1 of 11 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:35:28   :::                                                                     2                                7­FCA 227­18 Judgment.odt Petition   was   filed   by   the   present   Appellant   initially,   seeking declaration   that   the   marriage   between   the   Appellant   and   the Respondent   solemnized   on   28/05/1996   as   null   and   void.     By   an amendment,   the   prayer   was   amended   and   the   Appellant   sought declaration in respect of legal character / status of the Appellant and the Respondent in respect of the said marriage.  The Respondent had not   opposed   the   Appellant's   Petition,   neither   is   he   opposing   her Appeal before this Court.  2. The learned Judge of the Family Court, however, rejected the Petition as per the provisions of Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC.  The Appellant is challenging this order in the instant Appeal. 3. In her Petition before the Family Court, the Appellant had pleaded that she was Hindu and the Respondent was Christian.  They got married on 28/05/1996 in the presence of family and friends at Gowalia   Tank,   Mumbai.     The   marriage   was   registered   under   The Bombay Registration of Marriages Act, 1953 on 25/07/1996. URS                                                                                                                                                                        2 of 11 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:35:28   :::                                                                     3                                7­FCA 227­18 Judgment.odt 4. After   residing   together   for   a   considerable  period,   in  or about October 2014, differences arose between them.   They decided to  part   ways   and   find   different  paths.     Since   January   2016,   they started   residing   separately.     The   Appellant   filed   her   Petition   on 09/08/2017   before   the   Family   Court   at   Bandra.     Initially,   the Appellant   sought   declaration   that   the   marriage   solemnized   on 28/05/1996 be declared as null and void.   Subsequently, the prayer was amended and the Petitioner sought a declaration in respect of the legal character / status of the parties in respect of the said marriage. This amendment was carried out after the Court issued notice dated 04/06/2018  to  the  Appellant  as   to  why  the  Petition  ought  not  be rejected as per Order VII Rule 7 of the CPC.   The amendment was sought by the Petitioner in consonance with Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963.  The Respondent gave no objection for granting the relief to the Appellant as prayed by her.   5. The learned Judge observed that even after amendment, the   Petition   remained   for   the   declaration   that   the   marriage   be declared as null and void.   The learned Judge observed that as per Section 34 of the Specific Relief Act, the cause of action arose if one URS                                                                                                                                                                        3 of 11 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:35:28   :::                                                                     4                                7­FCA 227­18 Judgment.odt party was denying any civil right of the other party.  According to the learned Judge, no one was denying any civil right of the Petitioner and therefore, Section 34 of the said act was not applicable. 6. The learned Judge further relied on the case of Niranjani Roshan Rao Vs. Rosan Mark Pinto reported in 2014 (6) Mh.L.J. 277.   According   to  him,   the   ratio   in  Niranjani  Rao's   case   (supra) governs  the  fact  of   the Appellant's  case.    According to  the  learned Judge, in Niranjani Rao's case (supra), the order of rejection of plaint under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC was upheld and therefore, in the instant case also, the plaint was liable to be rejected under the same provisions.    The   learned Judge  rejected   the  Petitioner's   submission that her case was governed by the ratio of the case of  Neha Bhatia D/o Rakesh Bhatia Vs. Ferzad Palia S/o Cyrus Palia reported in 2016 SC OnLine Bm 11319.  7. The learned Judge further observed that the parties did not follow the law of the land when they got married.   He further observed that the parties wanted to legalize the illegal act.  According to the learned Judge, the parties had given false information to the URS                                                                                                                                                                        4 of 11 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:35:28   :::                                                                     5                                7­FCA 227­18 Judgment.odt public   authorities   and   therefore,   they   were   not   entitled   for   any equitable relief.  Finally, the learned Judge rejected the Petition as per Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC. 8. Before discussing the matter any further, we may observe that the learned Judge was rather harsh in observing that the parties had done illegal thing by getting married in the manner in which they had performed their marriage.   We also feel that the learned Judge's observation that the parties wanted to legalize the illegal act; was not appropriate.   The parties had got married as per Hindu rites though one of the parties was not a Hindu but for that, labeling their act as 'illegal' is unwarranted. 9. In   Niranjani   Rao's   case   (supra)   on   which   the   learned Judge had placed reliance, one of the parties was not a Hindu and the marriage was performed according to the Hindu rites and rituals.  The Petitioner who was a Hindu, had sought declaration that the marriage was null and void.  Her Petition was rejected under Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC on the ground that no cause of action was disclosed and the jurisdiction of the Court was barred under the provisions of the URS                                                                                                                                                                        5 of 11 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:35:28   :::                                                                     6                                7­FCA 227­18 Judgment.odt Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  In Niranjani Rao's case (supra), one of the parties  was  not  a  Hindu.    This  Court  considered   the  provisions  of Sections, 2, 5 and 11 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.   Section 5 provides conditions for a Hindu marriage.   It starts with the premise that the marriage may be solemnized between any two Hindus if the conditions  mentioned   in  Section  5  of   the  Hindu  Marriage  Act   are fulfilled.  Section 2 also provides that the Hindu Marriage Act applies to a person who was a Hindu by religion.  These two sections were not satisfied when one of the parties to the marriage was not a Hindu and therefore, the marriage could not be performed.  In that context, this Court   held   that   the   Petition   did   not   disclose   any   cause   of   action because the prayer was for nullity  of  marriage.    One more ground taken by the Appellant in that case that she was not aware that the husband was not a Hindu, was rejected by this Court as the parties knew each other   from childhood and  the  surname of   the husband would have shown that he was not a Hindu.   10. There is a vital difference between Niranjani's case (supra) and the instant case before us.  The learned Judge overlooked the fact that the prayer in the Petition before him was amended.  If the initial URS                                                                                                                                                                        6 of 11 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:35:28   :::                                                                     7                                7­FCA 227­18 Judgment.odt prayer made by the Petitioner had been maintained, then the ratio of Niranjani's case (supra) was squarely applicable.",

This   application   in   Family   Court   Appeal   is   by   the husband – appellant praying for an action against the first respondent – wife under   section  340  of   the   Code   of   Criminal   Procedure,   1973   (for   short “Cr.P.C.”). The case made out in the application in short is that the first respondent – wife made false and misleading statements  on oath in her reply   filed   to   Civil   Application   No.67   of   2016   and   in   Civil   Application No.220 of 2016 filed by her. On 24th  November 2017, submissions were heard   in   this  application.

Gross default has been   committed   by   the  Applicant.  The   submission   of   the Respondent appearing in person is that the stay be vacated.   3 of 27 :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:34   :::                                                                    4 cam-72.17 2.docx 2  If the Applicant wants indulgence, the Applicant will have to clear arrears of Rs.50,000/within a period of one week from today and will have to pay costs quantified at Rs.50,000/. Indulgence can be shown provided  the Applicant  gives  an unconditional undertaking to this Court to keep on paying the amount in terms of order dated 5th October, 2015. The learned counsel appearing for the Applicant seeks time. Place the  application  on  6th  April,  2016.  We make   it   clear   that unless the amounts as aforesaid are paid by the Applicant and undertaking is produced before the Court, no indulgence can be shown to the Applicant.” 5 On 13th April 2016, Civil Application No.67 of 2016 along with Civil Application Nos.11 and 14 of 2015 were placed before the Court on which the following order was passed : “2 The direction of the Family Court in the impugned decree is to make payment of permanent alimony of Rs.30,000/­ per month   to   the   wife   and   Rs.15,000/­   per   month   to   the daughter with effect from 13th November, 2007. Clause (6) of   the   impugned   decree   directs   the   applicant   to   provide separate accommodation to the wife or else to pay rent of Rs.15,000/­ per month.  3  It prima facie appears from the record that the applicant –  husband who  is  an  Orthopaedic  Surgeon has  a  very large income. Moreover, what is challenged is a money decree.   In   the   Appeal   preferred   by   the   applicant   – husband, this Court is not powerless to pass an order of interim maintenance by taking recourse to Section 24 of the Hindu Marriage Act, 1955.  4  Considering   the   nature   of   the   impugned   decree   and considering the fact that the impugned decree is a money decree,   the   applicant   will   have   to   deposit   the   entire amount due and payable as per the impugned decree as a condition for grant of stay. 5  Even otherwise, this is a fit case to exercise power of the Appellate Court under Sub­Rule 3 of Rule (1) of order XLI of   the  Code  of  Civil  Procedure,  1908  for  directing   the applicant appellant to comply with the monetary part of the decree.   4 of 27 :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:34   :::                                                                    5 cam-72.17 2.docx",

This second appeal challenges a judgment dated 14 March 2016 passed by the District Court at Thane in Regular Civil Appeal No.2 of 2015, confirming the judgment and decree dated 20 December 2014 passed by the Court of Civil Judge (Senior Division), Thane, in Regular Civil   Suit   No.376   of   2010.     By   this   latter   judgment   and   decree   the Appellant's suit was dismissed by the trial court. 2. It   is   the   case   of   the   Appellant   (original   “Plaintiff”)   that sometime in January 2007, he, like several others, entered into a flat purchase agreement with Respondent No.1 (original “Defendant No.1”). The agreement  referred  to  a   layout   (Layout  dated  19 January 2005) showing   15   buildings   to   be   constructed   by   Defendant   No.1   at   site, including the building containing the Plaintiff's flat.       The layout also showed various  open and amenity  spaces.    The  layout,   including  the buildings   and   open   as   well   as   amenity   spaces,   was   part   of   a   plan sanctioned  by   the   local  planning  authority,  namely,  Thane  Municipal Corporation,   and   shown   to   the   plaintiff   and   other   purchasers.   The Plaintiff   and  others   were   also   given  brochures   concerning   the   entire project, known as “Kores Nakshatra”, specifying 15 numbers of buildings together   with   various   open   and   amenity   spaces   and   depicting   their location as well as  areas.  In 2008­2009, the buildings were constructed. The buildings have since been duly occupied by the Plaintiff and other flat  purchasers.     Sometime  in  October  2009,   the  Plaintiff   and others noted some activities suggesting a proposed construction of an additional building, viz. Building No.16, on the suit property, i.e. the layout referred                                                                                                                      :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:34   ::: sg 3/27 sast11720­16.doc to   above.     The   Plaintiff,     through   his   advocate,   objected   to   such construction.  The planning authority, in response, rejected the proposal of   additional   construction.     In   December   2009,   fresh   plans   were submitted by Defendant No.1 through a new architect, once again, for construction of  additional  Building  No.16 with     some changes   in   the plans   rejected  earlier.    According   to   these  new plans,   the   additional building   was   proposed   to   be   constructed   by   utilizing   additional   FSI available to Defendant No.1 in the suit property by way of Transfer of Development   Rights   ('TDR').       The   plans   disclosed   the   proposal   for construction   of   Building   No.16   on   the   originally   proposed   area   of Recreation Ground ('RG') in the suit property.  Sometime in March 2010, the  Corporation  sanctioned  the  plans.    Being aggrieved,   the  Plaintiff, along with one other flat purchaser, filed the present suit.   The case of the   Plaintiff   before   the   trial   court  was   that   after   having  disclosed   a sanctioned layout containing 15 buildings and open and amenity spaces including RG and having executed agreements for sale on the basis of such disclosure, it was impermissible for Defendant No.1 to construct any additional building on the RG area of the layout without the consent of the flat purchasers including the Plaintiff.   Pending the hearing of the suit,  Defendant No.1 was  injuncted  from carrying out construction of Building No.16.  Evidence was led thereafter at the trial and the suit was heard.  On 20 December 2014, the trial court dismissed the suit.  A civil appeal  was  preferred   from  the  order   of   dismissal   before   the  District Court.   The appeal was dismissed on 14 March 2015.  Being aggrieved, the present second appeal is filed by the Plaintiff. 3. The appeal raises the following important question of law:                                                                                                                      :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:34   ::: sg 4/27 sast11720­16.doc Whether,   after   making   disclosure   to   flat   purchasers   of   a sanctioned   layout   plan   showing   a   certain   number   of buildings and open and amenity spaces including Recreation Ground ('RG') and their locations as per the requirements of Maharashtra   Ownership   Flats   Act   (“MOFA”),   it   is permissible   to   a   promoter   to   construct   an   additional building on the RG area shown in the layout plan without seeking consent from the flat purchasers? 4. The question arises in the context of the provisions of MOFA. Section 7 of MOFA, as it originally stood (i.e. prior to its amendment by Maharashtra Amending Act 36 of 1986), restricted the promoter's rights to make the following alterations, once the plans and specifications of a building, as approved by the local planning authority, were disclosed or furnished to any person who agrees  to  take one or more  flats   in   the building : (i)  any   alterations   in   the   structures   described   in   the   plans   and specifications in respect of the flat or flats agreed to be taken, without the previous consent of  that  person (Section 7(1)(i)); and (ii) any other alterations in the structure of the building, or construct any   additional   structures,  without   the   previous   consent   of   all persons who have agreed to take the flats (Section 7(1)(ii)). Construing this provision, particularly Section 7(1)(ii), this Court, in the                                                                                                                      :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:34   ::: sg 5/27 sast11720­16.doc case of Kalpita Enclave Co­op. Housing Society Ltd. vs. Kiran Builders (P) Ltd.1,  held that a promoter was not entitled to put up additional structures not shown in the original layout plan without the consent of the  flat  takers.    Section 7(1)(ii)  was  thereafter amended by the state legislature, particularly to get over its interpretation in Kalpita Enclave's case,   by   deleting   the   words   “or   construct   any   additional   structures” appearing in Section 7(1)(ii) and substituting them with the words “or additions in the structure of the building”.  The legislature also introduced, by way of abundant caution, Section 7A in MOFA, which provided that the deleted words, namely,  “or construct  any additional structures”, shall be   deemed   never   to   apply   in   respect   of   construction   of   any   other additional  buildings/structures  constructed or   to  be constructed.    The restriction,   thus,   after   the   amendment   brought   in   by   Maharashtra Amending Act 36 of 1986, applied to construction of “additions in the structure of the building” and not to “additional structures”, i.e. structures other   than   and   outside   the   building/s   disclosed   in   the   plans   and specifications.   The Supreme Court clarified this position in the case of Jayantilal Investments vs. Madhuvihar Co.op. Housing Society2.   At the same time, the  Supreme Court underlined the importance of other relevant provisions of MOFA, particularly Sections 3 and 4 thereof read with the Rules under MOFA prescribing inter alia the statutory form of a model   flat   purchase   agreement.  The  Court  held   that   at   the   stage  of disclosure of plans and specifications the promoter is obliged to declare in the layout plan whether the plot in question is capable of being loaded in future with additional FSI/floating FSI/TDR; he is obligated in law to place before the flat takers the entire project/scheme, be it one­building 1 1986 Mah LJ 110 : (1987) 1 Bom CR 355 2 (2007) ",

The petitioner Company is the owner of the property bearing Gut No. 59 Hissa No.1 (part), admeasuring 69 H­51R­07p situated at Village  Chitalsar,  Manpada,  Taluka  &  District  Thane.       (The   said property shall be hereinafter referred to as \"the subject property\". ) Shri   Narayan   Ganu   Tangdi,   the   predecessor   of   the   respondents nos.1/1 to 1/9 hereinafter referred to as the respondents) claimed to be an agricultural tenant in respect of the subject property.    In the pps 2 of 18 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 09/04/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 01/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:44   ::: 5 wp 6351-17 judg.doc year 1991 he filed an application under Section 70(b) of Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Lands Act,   1948   (B.T.&A.L.Act).     The petitioner   herein   initially   contested   the   said   proceeding   under Section   70(b).       However,   subsequently   the   petitioner   failed   to appear,  and by Order dated 23rd  February,  2004, the  learned ALT declared said Narayan Ganu Tangdi as  a protected tenant in respect of the subject property. 4. The petitioner   filed  an  appeal  before   the  SDO,  Thane  along with an application for condoning the delay of 11 years and 9 months in filing the tenancy appeal.     The petitioner claimed that it had no intimation whatsoever of the Order dated 24th February, 2004.   The petitioner   further stated that it had learnt about the said order for the first time on 23rd October, 2015.  The said order was received on 29th October, 2015, and an appeal with application for condonation of delay was filed immediately thereafter.  5. The   respondents   claimed   that   the   petitioner   had   filed     an application   under   Section   6   of   the   Forest   Act   before   the   Deputy Collector (Private Forest) Thane Division and requested to exclude pps 3 of 18 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 09/04/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 01/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:44   ::: 5 wp 6351-17 judg.doc the   subject   property   from   the   purview   of   the   Forest   Act.       Said Narayan   Tangdi   had   filed   an   intervention   application   in   the proceedings under Section 6 of the Private Forest Act contending that he   was   a   tenant   of   the   subject   property.     The   Deputy   Collector (Private Forest) Thane Division, Thane allowed the said intervention application and by judgment and order dated 27th December, 2004, exempted the subject property whereof Narayan Ganu Tangdi was a tenant   and   ordered   restoration   of   the   subject   property   to   the intervenor Narayan Tangdi.   6. The respondent therefore disputed that the petitioner had no knowledge about the proceedings under Section 70(b) of the B.T.& A.L.   Act.     The   respondents   claimed   that   Narayan   Tangdi   had participated in all forest proceedings till the year 2014 as he was in possession of the subject property and was declared as a tenant in 70(b) proceedings.      The respondents claimed that  the petitioners had full knowledge about the decision of 70(b) proceedings at every stage.    7. The  learned SDO allowed the application for condonation of pps 4 of 18 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 09/04/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 01/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:44   ::: 5 wp 6351-17 judg.doc delay  mainly on the ground that the Order under Section 70(b) was passed without serving a notice on the petitioner.    The learned SDO accepted the contention of the petitioner that they were not aware of the order passed in 70(b) proceeding and that they had learnt about the same for the first time on 21st  October, 2015.     Relying on the judgment  of   the   Apex   Court   in   N.   Balkrishnan   Vs.   M. Krishnamurthy (1998) 7 SCC 123, the SDO held that the delay was sufficiently explained and hence condoned the delay of 11 years and 9 months in filing the appeal.  8. The   respondents   challenged   the   said   Order   in   Revision Application  No.  TNC/REV/THN/L­150 of  2017.        The Revisional Authority   held   that   Narayan   Tangdi   had   intervened   in   the proceedings under Section 6 of the Forests Act and that the petitioner herein   was   fully   aware   that   he   was   participating   in   the   said proceeding   in   the   capacity  as   a   tenant  of   the   subject   land.    The Revisional Authority held that the petitioner had not explained the inordinate delay in filing the appeal and accordingly dismissed the application for condonation of delay.

Shri   Dhakephalkar,   learned   Sr.   Counsel   for   the   petitioner, submits  that  the proceedings under Section 70(b) were closed for Order on 5th  February, 2004 and that the Order was subsequently passed on 23rd February, 2004.     He submits that the petitioner had not received any intimation of the order passed in the proceedings under Section 70(b).      Relying upon the decision of this Court  in Sharadchandra   Malharrao   Ajinkya   &   Anr.   vs.   Markus   Philips Mendosa,   2003(5) Mh.L.J. 505,  the learned Sr. Counsel  submits that  by  virtue  of  Section  20  of  Mamlatdars  Courts  Act,  1906  the learned ALT was required to give due notice of the decision to the landlord, who was not present before him during the proceedings, or for that matter, on the day when the decision was pronounced. 10. Shri Dhakephalkar,  learned Sr. Counsel further contends that the revisional authority has interfered with the discretion exercised by the Appellate Authority without there being any material to show that due notice of   the decision was served on the petitioner.    He pps 6 of 18 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 09/04/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 01/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:44   ::: 5 wp 6351-17 judg.doc further  contends   that  even  in   the   reply   filed  before   the  Appellate Authority the respondents herein had not contended that the copy of the   order   passed   in   the   proceedings   under   Section   70(b)   was produced in the proceedings under Section 6 of the Private Forests Act   and/or   that   such  a   copy  was   served  on   the  petitioner.      He submits that such contention which is raised for the first time before this Court cannot be considered. 11. Shri Dani, the learned Sr. Counsel for the respondents disputes that the petitioner had no knowledge about the order passed under Section 70(b).     He has drawn my attention to the application for intervention filed by  the respondent in the proceeding under Section 6 of the Private Forest Act wherein the respondent had categorically stated that he had been declared as a tenant of the subject property. He submits   that   the  said   intervention application clearly   indicates that the copy of the order under Section 70(b) was annexed to the said application.",

The   counsel   submitted   that   the   view   taken   by   the learned Tribunal is totally contrary to the law, as laid down by the Hon’ble Apex Court in the case of Indra Sawhney & Others Vs. Union of India 2 , so also in the  judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in case of Asha D/o. Ramnath Gholap Vs. The President, District Selection Committee & Ors. 3 and a judgment of a Division Bench (Nagpur Bench) of this Court in Kanchan   Vishwanath   Jagtap   and   Another   Vs.

It   is   further   submitted   that   a   Division   Bench   of   this   Court (Aurangabad Bench) in the case of  The State of Maharashtra Vs. Irfan S/o.   Mustafa   Shaikh   &   Ors.5  has   held   that   in   so   far   as   horizontal reservation for Open category is concerned, the same is available only for the Open category candidates and the same is not available for candidate belonging to the reserved category. The counsel submitted that the Special Leave Petition challenging the same has also been dismissed by the Apex 2 1992 Supp. (3) SCC 215 3 2016 (3) ABR 376 4     2016 (1) Mh.L.J. 934 5 Writ Petition No. 272 of 2010 dt. 15.11.2010  Shraddha Talekar PS 5/15 :::   Uploaded on   - 07/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:49   ::: 6 914.wp.5397.2016=wp5363.2016.doc Court   holding   that  no   reason   for   interference   was   made   out   with   the reasoning given by this Court. It is, therefore, submitted that the law laid down   by   a   Division   Bench   of   this   Court   in   case   of  The   State   of Maharashtra Vs. Irfan S/o. Mustafa Shaikh & Ors. (Supra) is considered by   the  Hon'ble  Apex  Court   as   the   correct   legal  position.  The  Member, therefore, has not erred in following the law laid down therein. 11 A Division Bench of this Court in case of Smt. Kanchan Vishwanath Jagtap (Supra) had an occasion to consider the identical issue. It will be relevant  to refer  the  judgment and order of   this  Court   in case of  Smt. Kanchan Vishwanath Jagtap (Supra). The Division Bench, after referring to the law laid down by the Apex Court in the case of Rajesh Kumar Daria (Supra) as well as in the judgment of the Constitution Bench of the Apex Court in case of Indra Sawhney & Others (Supra) has observed thus :­ “6 The  only  question   that   falls   for   consideration   in   the present writ petitions is as to whether the learned Tribunal has rightly considered the law laid down by the Apex Court in the Case of Rajesh Kumar Daria (supra) or not. 7.  Their Lordships of the Apex Court were considering the selection   to   the   post   of   Munsiff­Magistrate   in   the   Rajasthan Judicial   Service   made   by   the   Rajasthan   Public   Service Commission.   In   the   said   case   it   can   be   seen   that   in   the advertisement issued, the advertisement specifically provided for number of posts available for male as well as female in various categories including Open, SC, ST and OBC. It will be relevant to refer to the observations of the Apex Court in the case of Rajesh Kumar Daria (supra) in paragraph Nos. 8 and 9:­ Shraddha Talekar PS 6/15 :::   Uploaded on   - 07/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:49   ::: 7 914.wp.5397.2016=wp5363.2016.doc \"8.  We  may   also   refer   to   two   related   aspects   before considering the facts of this case. The first is about the description   of   horizontal   reservation.   For   example,   if there   are   200   vacancies   and   15%   is   the   vertical reservation   for   SC   and   30%   is   the   horizontal reservation   for  women,   the  proper   description  of   the number of posts reserved for SC, should be : \"For SC : 30 posts, of which 9 posts are for women\".",

Rule is made returnable forthwith. By consent, heard finally. 2 The petitioner has approached this Court challenging the impugned communications dated and 29th March 2017 and 18th April 2017 whereby the petitioner  was directed by respondent  No.2 to  submit  caste  validity certificate failing which his services were liable to be terminated.  3 The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner's father was working in respondent No.2 on the post of Asst. Lineman. On 20th September 2003, petitioner's father died due to ill health. On the death of the petitioner's father, the mother of the petitioner came to be appointed in his place on temporary basis. However, she subsequently relinquished her appointment in the name of the petitioner with a request to appoint the Shraddha Talekar PS 1/3 :::   Uploaded on   - 07/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:49   ::: 2 915.wp.2339.2018.doc petitioner on compassionate ground. Thereafter, the petitioner applied for the   employment   on   compassionate   ground.  Respondent  No.2,  by  order dated 19th  July 2014, appointed the petitioner on temporary basis on the post  of  Jr.  Office  Assistant.  By an order  dated  26 th  February 2016,   the petitioner was declared as permanent employee.   4 By   the   impugned   communication   dated   29th  March   2017,   the petitioner has been informed that since his appointment was made under scheduled   tribe   category,   he   is   required   to   submit   the   caste   validity certificate and, as such, on failure to submit the caste validity certificate, his  appointment will   liable  to be cancelled.   In  this  context,   the learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon the judgment of a Division Bench in Pramod Shivaji Shinde Vs. State of Maharashtra & Ors.1.  5 The learned counsel for respondent Nos.1 to 3 supported the stand taken by respondent No.2. However,  no material   is  placed before us to indicate that the appointment of the petitioner was on a post reserved for the   scheduled   tribe   category   and,   therefore,   respondent   No.2   was   not justified in demanding a caste validity certificate.  6 On perusal of the material on record and the annexed documents, it is   revealed   that   the   appointment   of   the   petitioner   was   purely   on compassionate   ground   and  not   under   any   reserved   category.   As  noted 1 2017 (3) Mh. L.J. 925 Shraddha Talekar PS 2/3 :::   Uploaded on   - 07/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:49   ::: 3 915.wp.2339.2018.doc above, the petitioner's father was working with respondent No.2 who died in   harness.   Petitioner's   mother   relinquished   her   rights   and,   thus,   the petitioner   came   to   be   appointed   on   compassionate   ground   by   the communication dated 26th February 2016. In view of the settled position of law that unless the Rules and the Policy of the State specifically carve out or provide a reservation policy applicable to compassionate appointments, there cannot be a presumption that a compassionate appointment would be subject   to   the   validation   of   a   caste   or   a   tribe   claim   only   because   the candidate belongs to a scheduled caste or tribe.  7 In   view   of   above,   the   petition   is   allowed.   The   impugned communications dated 29th March 2012 and 18th April 2017 are quashed and set aside. Since in the impugned communications itself, it is mentioned that the petitioner is appointed on compassionate ground, the petitioner is not required to submit his caste validity certificate.  8 Rule  is  made absolute  in  the aforesaid terms with no order as to costs.

It   is   pertinent   to   note     that   the petitioner  was awarded  the contract  for South Area; whereas, one  M/s.BVG  India   Limited   was   allotted   contract   for  North Borey                        4/38 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 12/02/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:26   ::: spb/                    wp13820-18-J-R.doc Area.   The resolution  was   passed by the standing committee to   cancel   the   contract   awarded     for   both  North   and  South Areas.   The Petitioner   is concerned with resolution no. 2551, by which the decision   was taken to cancel  the contract    of South Area which was   allotted to the petitioner.   On   02.05.2018,   a   resolution   was   passed   by   the standing committee to issue a fresh tender  by dividing  the city into eight zones.  In pursuance of the said resolution,   on 15 th September,   2018,     fresh   tenders   were   floated   by   the Respondent No.2 ­Corporation for collection and transportation of the garbage by dividing the city in four parts.  The petitioner preferred   representation  on 05th October, 2018,  reducing the tonnage   rate   to   Rs.   1570/­   metric   tonne   and   the   standing committee on 9th October, 2018, passed  a resolution vide No. 3314,  by  which   it   cancelled   its  earlier     resolution  no.  2551 dated 11.04.2018.   It also   cancelled earlier     resolution   no. 2626 dated 02.05.2018, by which  it  had resolved to  issue a fresh tender and by the said resolution, the standing committee stayed the E­tender issued on 15.09.2018.  The said   resolution of the Standing Committee provided for complete redressal of petitioners  grievance.     Further,  on  12.10.2018,   a   letter  was addressed   by  the PCMC/ Respondent  No.2,     requesting the petitioner     to   submit   his   concurrence     to   the   resolution no.3314 passed by the Standing Committee on 09.10.2018 and accordingly,   on   15.10.2018,   the   petitioner   submitted   its acceptance.

The   claim   of Jagdish Pralhad Pardeshi  has been held as  valid  by an order  dated 2nd February 2007. The claim of the another brother of the petitioner Mahesh Pralhad Pardeshi has been validated on 19th March 2003. The petitioner, in support of his claim, has annexed the caste certificates of his other relatives also. In spite of this, the claim of the petitioner came to be rejected vide order dated 8th July 2013.  4 The petitioner, therefore, approached this Court vide Writ Petition No.   6800   of   2013.   This   Court,   vide   order   dated   18 th  February   2014, quashed and set aside the order dated 8th July 2013 passed by respondent No.2 in view of the law laid down in a judgment of a Division Bench of this Court in Apoorva d/o Vinay Nichale Vs. 1. Divisional Caste Certificate Scrutiny Committee No.1 & Ors.1 wherein it was held that if a Committee has given finding about the validity of the caste of a candidate, another committee could not refuse the same status to a blood relative who applies subsequently. A merely different view on the same facts would not entitle the   Committee   dealing   with   the   subsequent   caste   claim   to   reject   it. 1 2010 Mh.L.J. 401 Shraddha Talekar PS 2/4 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 31/01/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 07/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:50   ::: 3 908.wp.7345.2014.doc Therefore,  the Court observed that the order of the Scrutiny Committee was   not   sustainable   and   the   same   was   set   aside   and   the   matter   was remitted back to the Scrutiny Committee for reconsideration. 5 We have perused the order of the Scrutiny Committee. The Scrutiny Committee, after referring to the validity certificates of the real brothers of the petitioner, has held that the same are not binding upon the Committee since the petitioner has not produced any pre­1961 document. 6 We find  that   the  approach of   the  Committee   is  apart   from being illegal,  also   contemptuous   in  nature.  The  petitioner,   in  addition   to   the other relevant documents, has produced the validity certificates of his real brothers so also his validity claim is held genuine by the Vigilance Cell. There is no doubt that the report of the Vigilance Cell is not binding on the Committee.   If   the   Committee   is   of   the   view   that   the   claims   of   the petitioner's   brothers   were   validated   by   practicing   fraud,   the   Scrutiny Committee   should   have   taken   action   against   the   petitioner's   brothers. However, that has not been done. Merely because pre­1961 documents are not   available,   that   cannot   be   a   ground   for   rejecting   the   claim   of   the petitioner.  7 In view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Apex Court in  Anand Vs.

Heard by consent of parties. 2] Petitioner  has  approached   this  Court   being   aggrieved  by   the order   dated   09/01/2014   vide   which   a   minor   penalty   has   been imposed   on   the   Petitioner,   thereby   withholding   one   increment without having cumulative effect. 3] Heard   Mr.   Bandiwadekar,   the   learned  Counsel   appearing  on 2/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 21/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:17   ::: (33)-WP-1852-14.doc behalf of the Petitioner and Mr. Jalisatgi, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Respondent Nos. 1 and 2. 4] Petitioner  was  appointed  as  Food   Inspector  with  Respondent No.1 – Corporation.   Petitioner was directed to perform his duty as per the provisions of the Food Adulteration (Prevention) Act,  1954 under the supervision of Respondent No.2.   However, subsequently, designation  of   the   “Food   Inspector”  came   to  be  changed  as   “Food Safety Officer” and they came under the administrative control of the Food Safety Commissioner. 5] Petitioner   was   served   with   show   cause   notice   dated 11/10/2013, asking upon him to show cause, as to why action be not taken against him for various misconducts.   Petitioner replied to the said show cause notice on 14/10/2013.   However, Respondent No.2 was not satisfied with the reply given by the Petitioner and as such, by the impugned order dated 09/01/2014, the penalty, as aforesaid, has been awarded. 3/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 21/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:17   ::: (33)-WP-1852-14.doc 6] The   learned  Counsel  appearing  on  behalf  of   the  Corporation vehemently opposes the Petition.   He submits that Respondent No.2 has   passed   an   order   after   taking   into   consideration   the   relevant factors.   7] We   find   that   the   Petition   deserves   to   be   allowed   on   two grounds.  Firstly, perusal of the show cause notice would reveal that allegations made against the Petitioner in the show cause notice are totally vague in nature.  It is settled law that if the allegations in the show cause notice are vague, it would not be possible for delinquent to effectively submit his reply and therefore the same would violate the principles of natural justice. 8] Secondly, Petition deserves to be allowed on the ground that the impugned  order  does  not  give  any   reasons.    Perusal  of   the  order would reveal that no reasons are given even for name sake. The issue is no more  res integra.   Division Bench of this Court in the case of Gajanan Babu Patil vs. State of Maharashtra and others1 has observed thus :­ 1 2003(1) Mh.L.J.988 4/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 21/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:17   ::: (33)-WP-1852-14.doc “8.  The legal position that the disciplinary authority as also the appellate authority has to give reasoned order is always settled and has now been finally laid down by   the   Full   Bench   of   this   Court   interpreting   the provisions of Maharashtra Rules regarding conduct of departmental enquiry and proceedings.  This Court has specifically laid down the manner in which the orders are to be passed.   We introduced what has been laid down by the Full Bench suffice to say that the orders passed   by   the   disciplinary   authority   as   also   the appellate authority required to be speaking order.   As observed   already   the   order   of   the   disciplinary authority   as   also   the   appellate   authority   is   not   a speaking   order   and   consequently   they   are   not sustainable in law.   Even if it is assumed in favour of the   respondent   that   the   disciplinary   authority   itself being enquiring authority and it has given an enquiry report   holding   the   petitioner   guilty,   no   additional reasons need be given in the order of punishment.  In such a case, according to law, more responsibility lies on   the   earlier   authority   to   give   its   finding  on   each point raised.   The appellate court has totally failed to perform its duty.  No reason has given why the appeal of the Petitioner was dismissed.  No reason is given to 5/6 :::   Uploaded on   - 21/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:17   ::: (33)-WP-1852-14.doc defend   the   insufficiency   of   evidence   or   absence   of evidence.    We therefore find it   impossible  to sustain the orders of punishment as passed by the authorities below.     In   the result   therefore   the petition  succeeds and it is allowed.”   9] We are of the view that the impugned order deserves to be quashed and set aside on the short ground of violation of Rule 10 of the Maharashtra Civil Services [Discipline and Appeal] Rules, 1979. 10] In the result,  Petition is  allowed.    Rule  is  made absolute  in terms of prayer clauses (b) and (d).  (N. J. JAMADAR, J.)                       (B. R.

He contends  that   the previous proceedings having been dropped,   the subsequent proceedings under Section 32G are barred by the principles of res­judicata. 5. Mr. A.V.

The learned counsels for the respective parties have relied upon several decisions of the Apex Court and of this Court to explain the scope and object of Section 11 of the CPC.  In order to appreciate the contentions raised by the learned counsels for the respective parties, it would be advantageous to consider the scope of section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code which reads thus :­ S.11 Res Judicata  \" No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties,  or between parties  under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such Court. Explanation I: The expression “former suit” shall denote a suit which has been decided prior to the suit in question whether or not it was instituted prior thereto. Explanation II: For the purpose of this section, the competence of a Court shall be determined irrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of such Court. Explanation III: The matter above referred to must in the former suit have been alleged by one party and either  denied or  admitted, expressly or impliedly, by the other. Explanation IV: Any   matter   which   might   and   ought   to   have   been   made PPS / P.H.

Explanation V: Any   relief   claimed   in   the   plaint,   which   is   not   expressly granted by the decree, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been refused. Explanation VI: Where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right  or of a private right claimed in common for themselves and  others, all persons interested in such right shall, for the  purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the  persons so litigating. Explanation VII: The provisions of this section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of a decree and references in this section to any   suit,   issue   or   former   suit   shall   be   construed   as references, respectively, to a proceeding for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding and a former proceeding for the execution of that decree. Explanation VIII: An issue heard and finally decided by a Court of  limited jurisdiction, competent to decide such issue, shall operate as res   Judicata   in   a   subsequent   suit,   notwithstanding   that such Court of limited jurisdiction was not competent to try such   subsequent   suit   in   which   such   issue   has   been subsequently raised.  ” 7. In  M.  Nagabhusana   vs.   State   of  Karnataka  AIR  2011  SC 1113, the Apex Court, while explaining the object of the Section 11 of the CPC has observed thus :­ PPS / P.H.

Interest   reipublicae   ut   sit   finis   litium which means that it is in the interest of the State that there should be an end to the litigation and the other principle is Rs. nemo debet his ve ari, si constet curiae quod sit pro un aet eademn   cause meaning thereby that no one ought to be vexed twice in a litigation if it appears to the Court that it is for one and the same cause.  This doctrine of Res Judicata is common to all civilized system of  jurisprudence to the extent that a judgment after a proper trial by a Court of competent jurisdiction should be regarded as final and conclusive determination   of   the   questions   litigated   and   should forever set the controversy at rest. ”   8. In  Dadu   Dayalu   Mahasabha,   Jaipur   (Trust)   v/s.   Mahant Ram Niwas and Anr.  2008 (2)  G.L.H.  557,   the  Apex Court  has reiterated   that   to   constitute   a   matter   res   judicata,   the   following conditions must be satisfied namely :­  “(i)   the   matters   directly   and   substantially   in   issue   in   the subsequent suit or issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit.  (ii) the former suit must have been a suit between the same parties  or between parties  under whom they or any of   them claim.  (iii) The parties must have litigated under the same title in the former suit.

Further Explanation 1 shows that it is not on the date on which the suit is filed the matters but the date on which the suit is decided, so that even if a suit was filed   later,   it   will   be   a   former   suit   if   it   has   been   decided earlier . ” 9.    In  State  of  Maharashtra & Anr.  vs.  National    Construction Company Bombay and Anr.  (1996) 1 SCC 735,  the  Apex Court while considering the scope of Section 11 has held that:­  \"the important words are 'has been heard and finally decided.' The bar applies only when the matter directly and substantially in issue in the former suit has been heard and finally decided by a Court competent to try such suit.  That clearly means on the matter or issue in question there has been an application of the judicial mind and a final adjudication made.",

In order to appreciate the contentions raised by the learned counsels for the respective parties, it would be advantageous to consider the scope of section 11 of the Civil Procedure Code which reads thus :­ S.11 Res Judicata  \" No Court shall try any suit or issue in which the matter directly and substantially in issue has been directly and substantially in issue in a former suit between the same parties,  or between parties  under whom they or any of them claim, litigating under the same title, in a Court competent to try such subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue has been subsequently raised, and has been heard and finally decided by such Court. Explanation I: The expression “former suit” shall denote a suit which has been decided prior to the suit in question whether or not it was instituted prior thereto. Explanation II: For the purpose of this section, the competence of a Court shall be determined irrespective of any provisions as to a right of appeal from the decision of such Court. Explanation III: The matter above referred to must in the former suit have been alleged by one party and either  denied or  admitted, expressly or impliedly, by the other. Explanation IV: Any   matter   which   might   and   ought   to   have   been   made PPS / P.H.

Explanation V: Any   relief   claimed   in   the   plaint,   which   is   not   expressly granted by the decree, shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to have been refused. Explanation VI: Where persons litigate bona fide in respect of a public right  or of a private right claimed in common for themselves and  others, all persons interested in such right shall, for the  purposes of this section, be deemed to claim under the  persons so litigating. Explanation VII: The provisions of this section shall apply to a proceeding for the execution of a decree and references in this section to any   suit,   issue   or   former   suit   shall   be   construed   as references, respectively, to a proceeding for the execution of the decree, question arising in such proceeding and a former proceeding for the execution of that decree. Explanation VIII: An issue heard and finally decided by a Court of  limited jurisdiction, competent to decide such issue, shall operate as res   Judicata   in   a   subsequent   suit,   notwithstanding   that such Court of limited jurisdiction was not competent to try such   subsequent   suit   in   which   such   issue   has   been subsequently raised.  ” 7. In  M.  Nagabhusana   vs.   State   of  Karnataka  AIR  2011  SC 1113, the Apex Court, while explaining the object of the Section 11 of the CPC has observed thus :­ PPS / P.H.

Interest   reipublicae   ut   sit   finis   litium which means that it is in the interest of the State that there should be an end to the litigation and the other principle is Rs. nemo debet his ve ari, si constet curiae quod sit pro un aet eademn   cause meaning thereby that no one ought to be vexed twice in a litigation if it appears to the Court that it is for one and the same cause.  This doctrine of Res Judicata is common to all civilized system of  jurisprudence to the extent that a judgment after a proper trial by a Court of competent jurisdiction should be regarded as final and conclusive determination   of   the   questions   litigated   and   should forever set the controversy at rest. ”   8. In  Dadu   Dayalu   Mahasabha,   Jaipur   (Trust)   v/s.   Mahant Ram Niwas and Anr.  2008 (2)  G.L.H.  557,   the  Apex Court  has reiterated   that   to   constitute   a   matter   res   judicata,   the   following conditions must be satisfied namely :­  “(i)   the   matters   directly   and   substantially   in   issue   in   the subsequent suit or issue must be the same matter which was directly and substantially in issue in the former suit.  (ii) the former suit must have been a suit between the same parties  or between parties  under whom they or any of   them claim.  (iii) The parties must have litigated under the same title in the former suit.   (iv) The Court which decided the former suit must be a Court competent to try the subsequent suit or the suit in which such issue is subsequently raised.  PPS / P.H.

Further Explanation 1 shows that it is not on the date on which the suit is filed the matters but the date on which the suit is decided, so that even if a suit was filed   later,   it   will   be   a   former   suit   if   it   has   been   decided earlier . ” 9.    In  State  of  Maharashtra & Anr.  vs.  National    Construction Company Bombay and Anr.  (1996) 1 SCC 735,  the  Apex Court while considering the scope of Section 11 has held that:­  \"the important words are 'has been heard and finally decided.' The bar applies only when the matter directly and substantially in issue in the former suit has been heard and finally decided by a Court competent to try such suit.",

The background facts which  led to this petition can be stated, in brief, as under: a)  Umrane   Agricultural   Produce   Market   Committee came   to  be   established  on  28th  June,  2012.  The  Petitioners herein were elected as the members of the Managing Committee of the Market Committee on 14th March, 2016. On account of certain   developments   affecting   liquidity   in   market,   certain issues   arose.   While   the   Petitioners   were   addressing   those issues,   the   agriculturalists,   who   had   sold   the   agricultural produce   to   the   traders   in   the   market   committee,   made   a grievance that the price of their agricultural produce has not been paid within the stipulated time.  b)   Respondent   no.2,   District   Deputy   Registrar   issued directions to the market committee under Section 40 of the Act, inter alia, directing the market committee to ensure immediate and   scrupulous   compliance   of   Rule   20   of   the   Maharashtra 3/25 :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   ::: WPST29743-18 Agricultural  Produce Marketing  Committee   (Development and Regulation) Rules, 1967 (hereinafter referred to “the Rules”, for short)  and the Rule 24 of   the Market Committee Model bye­ laws.   The   Petitioners   apprised   Respondent   no.2   about   the action   taken   to   ensure  payment   of   the   price   of   agricultural produce to the agriculturalists, within the stipulated period, by communication dated 4th December, 2017.  c) Though the Petitioners were making all the efforts to streamline   the   functioning   of   the   market   committee, Respondent no.2, without conducting an enquiry, as envisaged under Section 40 of the Act, called upon the Petitioners and the other members of the managing committee to show cause as to why,  inter alia, the market committee may not be superseded under  Section 45(1)  of   the Act  and an Administrator  be not appointed. The Petitioners gave reply to the show cause notice on  23rd  April,   2018  pointing   out   the   action   initiated  by   the Petitioners and the unjustifiability of the proposed action. Yet, Respondent  no.2,  by  order  dated  13th  July,  2018 passed an order under Section 45(1) of the Act and thereby superseded market   committee   and   appointed   Assistant   Registrar,   Co­ operative Societies, Nandgaon, as the Administrator. 4/25 :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   ::: WPST29743-18 d) Being   aggrieved  by   the   said   order   the  Petitioners preferred Writ Petition No.7869 of 2018. This Court vide order dated 24th  July,  2018, quashed and set aside the said order dated   13th  July,   2018   and   remitted   back   the   matter   for consideration   to   Respondent   no.2,   for   the   reason   that   the officer who had extended opportunity of hearing had not passed the order impugned therein. Respondent no.2 was thus directed to provide an opportunity of hearing to the Petitioners and all the parties concerned, and pass order afresh.    e) The   Petitioners   appeared   before   Respondent   no.2 and   submitted   additional   reply   and   thereby   brought   to   the notice of Respondent no.2 the subsequent developments. After hearing   the   parties   and   consulting   the   Maharashtra   State Agricultural   Marketing   Board,   Respondent   no.6   passed   an order on 9th  October, 2018 and again superseded the market committee under Section 45(1)  of   the Act and appointed Mr. Sanjay Gite, Assistant Registrar, Co­operative Societies, Deola, District Nashik, as the Administrator to administer the affairs of the market committee. The Petitioners have thus invoked the Writ of Jurisdiction of this Court.  5. The substance of the petition is that, firstly, the impugned order has been passed for extraneous consideration. Secondly, 5/25 :::   Uploaded on   - 25/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   ::: WPST29743-18 despite   substantial   compliance   of   the   directions   issued   by Respondent no.2 under Section 40 of the Act, Respondent no.2 has superseded a democratically elected managing committee under   political   pressure.   Thirdly,   the   directions   issued   by Respondent no.2 under Section 40 of the Act, were in breach of the   Rules,   1967   as   those   directions   ought   to   have   been preceded by an enquiry contemplated by Rule 117 of the Rules, 1967.   Fourthly,   the   prime   factor   which   weighed   with   the Respondent no.2 i.e. failure to recover the market committee fee and supervision fee to the tune of Rs.3,66,59,373/­, attributed to the Petitioners, was not the subject matter of the show cause notice dated 23rd April, 2018 and thus could not have formed the basis of the impugned order. Lastly, there was no effective consultation   with   the   State   Agricultural   Marketing   Board, Respondent no.6, and thus the entire exercise is vitiated.",

By  this  Writ  Petition  filed  under  Article  227  of  the Constitution of India, the petitioner has impugned the order dated 28 June 2018 passed by the learned District Judge - 4, Kalyan in Miscellaneous  Civil  Appeal  No.13  of  2018  dismissing  the  said Miscellaneous Civil Appeal filed by the petitioner arising out of the order dated 6th January 2018 passed by the learned Civil  Judge Junior  Division, Kalyan granting temporary injunction in favour of the respondent no.1 in Regular Civil Suit No.625 of 2017. Some of the relevant facts for the purpose of deciding this Writ Petition are as under :- The petitioner is the original defendant no.2 whereas the respondent no.1 is original  Plaintiff.  The respondent Nos.2 and 3 hereinafter referred to as original defendant Nos.1 and 3 in Regular Civil Suit No.625 of 2017. 2. It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner has been doing the business of manufacturing and sale of chemicals and has a  plant  at  Village  Mohane,  Taluka  Kalyan,  District  Thane.   The petitioner made an application to the respondent no.2 for Line in Line Out ('LILO') on 100 kv Mohone-Ambernath DC TL for 100 kv proposed sub-station to supply power from 22 kv line to 100 kv. The respondent  no.2  addressed  a  letter  to  MSETCL  being  a transmission  authority  empowered  under  section  164  of  the Electricity Act, 2003 ( in short – 'Electricity Act').  It is the case of the 2 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   :::                                                              wpl19175-18.doc petitioner that the said MSETCL approved the scheme of 100kv DC transmission line for giving 19.2. MVA power to the petitioner under the supervision of MSETCL.  According to the Petitioner, the entire procedure of execution of work was provided under clause no.3.2 of the  Conditions  of  Supply  Based  on  the  Maharashtra  Electricity Regulatory  Commission  (Electricity  Supply  Code  and  Other Conditions of Supply) Regulations, 2005. 3. It is the case of the petitioner that as per the terms and conditions of  MSETCL has been paid supervision charges on 22nd June, 2016 for executing the work of laying down the transmission lines.  The work and route for tower line was approved by MSETCL. The  petitioner  under  supervision  and  in  accordance  with  the sanctioned scheme allotted  work to one M/s.Shivam Contractors, being the approved contractor  of  MSETCL for  erection of  towers under the supervision of respondent no.2.  The petitioner started the excavation work from 1st December, 2017 and excavation work of Tower 2.   4. It is the case of the petitioner that the said line cannot be termed  strictly  as  a  Dedicated  Feeder  Line.  The  petitioner  had made  an  application  for  LILO  on  100  kv  Mohone-Ambernath transmission line.  It is the case of the petitioner that the petitioner had already completed 80% of the work.  Mr.Rushikesh Karanvikar raised an obstruction on 22nd December 2017 for not allowing the petitioner  to  erect  the  towers.  On  26th December,  2017,  the respondent no.1 herein filed a suit bearing No.625 of 2017 before the learned Civil Judge, Junior Division, Kalyan under section 34, 37 and 38 of the Specific Relief Act, 1963  inter-alia praying for a 3 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   :::                                                              wpl19175-18.doc declaration that the defendants act of excavation of soil for erecting high tension electric towers in suit lands without lawfully acquiring the required portion of the suit property for the said purpose was per-se illegal,  void-ab-initio since the Plaintiffs were owners of the suit land.  The defendant no.1 also prayed for permanent injunction against the defendants to the suit and its officers, agents, servants, employees  and contractors  restraining  them from excavating  the soil for the purpose of erecting high tension electric towers from any part of the suit property unless and until required portion of the suit property was lawfully acquired by following  due process of law. 5. The defendant no.2 also prayed for issuing mandatory injunction against the defendants to the said suit  and its officers, agents,  servants,  employees  and  contractors  directing  them  to restore to its original position the suit lands by refilling the soil in the excavated portion of the land.  In the said suit the petitioner herein is  impleaded  as  defendant  no.2  whereas  the  respondent  no.2 herein  and respondent  no.3  have  been  impleaded  as  defendant no.1 and 3 respectively.  In the said suit, the defendant no.2 applied for  interim  reliefs,  restraining  the  defendants  in  the  said  suit including the petitioner herein by way of temporary injunction from making  holes  for  erecting  the  poles  from  any  part  of  the  suit property unless and until required portion of the suit property was lawfully required.  6. On  6  January  2018,  the  learned  Civil  Judge,  Junior Division, Kalyan granted the said temporary injunction as prayed for by respondent no.1 herein (original Plaintiff).  The petitioner herein challenged the said order dated 6 January, 2018 by filing appeal 4 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   :::                                                              wpl19175-18.doc before the learned District  Court,  Kalyan.  On 25 April,  2018,  the District Court suspended the order dated 6 January, 2018 passed by  the  learned  Civil  Judge  (J.D.)  Kalyan  subject  to  payment  of advance  compensation  of  Rs.3,50,000/-  to  be  deposited  on  or before 27 April, 2018. By an order dated 28 June, 2018 passed by the learned District Judge, the said Miscellaneous Appeal No.13 of 2018 filed by the petitioner came to be dismissed.  Being aggrieved by the said order dated 28 June, 2018, the petitioner preferred this Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India. 7. Ms.Deepa  Chavan,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner invited my attention to various annexures in the Writ Petition and some of the documents forming part of the compilation filed before this Court. She also invited my attention to various averments in the plaint filed by respondent no.1 herein and the prayers thereof.  It is submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  that  the  respondent  no.1  had challenged the erection of electric towers with high tension wires on the ground that services of the respondent no.3 were hired as a Contractor  for  carrying  out  work.  The  work  in  question  was  not carried  out  either  by  the  petitioner  or  by  the  respondent  no.2. respondent  no.2  did  not  acquire  the  suit  land  owned  by  the respondent  no.1.   No  permission  or  approval  of  the  respondent no.1 was taken before carrying out any work on the suit plot. 8. The learned counsel  placed reliance on the prayers in the plaint along with averments as contended in paragraph Nos.6 to 9 and submits that the said prayers itself are untenable in law. She submits that since the final relief as prayed by the respondent no.1 in the said suit itself could not be granted under any provisions of 5 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:22   :::                                                              wpl19175-18.doc law, no interim relief as prayed for by the respondent no.1 could be granted  by the  learned  trial  Judge  in  the  said  Application  below Exhibit 5.  The learned District Judge thus, ought to have interfered with the said interim order passed by the learned trial Judge in the appeal preferred by the petitioner.  It is submitted by the learned counsel that no consent of the land owner is required when powers are  exercised   by  a  licensee  under  section  164  of  the  said Electricity Act.  9. In  support  of  this  statement,  learned  counsel  placed reliance  on  the  Judgment  in  the  case  of  Jarnail  Singh  vs. Maharashtra State Electricity Transmission Co. Ltd.",

Shivaji Gulab Kokate & Ors. … Respondents Mr. S.S. Salunkhe for the Petitioner.  Mr. R.S. Pawar, A.G.P. for Respondent Nos.2 to 6­ State.  CORAM : R.M. BORDE  AND  V.L. ACHLIYA, JJ. DATE     : 8th JANUARY 2019. ORAL JUDGMENT : (Per : R.M. BORDE, J.) 1 Heard.  Rule.   With the consent of the parties the Petition is taken up for final hearing at the admission stage.   2 The Petitioner is the owner of land Gat No.422/2 situated at Vadgaon Bhande, Tal. Daund, District Pune, and out of said Gat number an area   to   the  extent  of  2H 42R came  to  be  acquired   for   the  Bhama Askhed project.   It is not a matter of dispute that land belonging to the Petitioner is situated in benefited zone and a notification in that regard came to be issued by the State on 10.05.1994.  It is the contention of the Petitioner   that   the   area   referred   to   above,   is   a   matter   of   acquisition proceeding initiated by the State and an award in that regard has been Waghmare 1/11 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:24   :::                                  10.WP.10413.17.doc declared on 31.10.2001.  It is the contention of the Petitioner that though the award has been declared in the year 2001, neither the possession of the acquired land has been taken over nor the amount of compensation has been paid to the petitioner.   It is further contended that in view of provision   of   Section   24(2)   of   the   Right   to   Fair   Compensation   and Transparency  in Land Acquisition,  Rehabilitation and Resettlement Act, 2013,   the   land  belonging   to   the  Petitioner  which   is   subject  matter  of acquisition shall be deemed to have been released from acquisition and award proceeding shall be deemed to have lapsed.   3 An affidavit­in­reply has been presented by the Sub­Divisional Officer, Pune, controverting the contentions raised by the Petitioner.  It is contended by the Respondents that the Petitioner’s land has been acquired in observance of the procedure prescribed by law.  It is further stated that the possession of the land has been taken over.   It is further pointed out that after taking over the possession, the land has been distributed in the year  2016   to   the  beneficiaries.     So   far   as   the  payment  of   amount  of compensation  is  concerned,   it   is  contended that   the  Petitioner  has  not accepted the amount of compensation.  During the course of argument the learned A.G.P. appearing for the State has tendered a photostat copy of Waghmare 2/11 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:24   :::                                  10.WP.10413.17.doc the notice allegedly issued to the Petitioner’s father on 21.11.2006.   It is contended that the landholder/the claimant was called upon to receive the amount of compensation determined under the award on 01.12.2006.  It is thus contended that inspite of service of notice under Section 12(2) of the Act 2013, the landholder failed to receive the amount of compensation and as such the consequences provided under Section 24(2) of the Act 2013 shall not ensue and the proceedings of acquisition shall not lapse. The Petitioner contends that his father has passed away on 01.08.2003 whereas the notice within contemplation of Section 12(2) of the Act of 2013   is   stated   to   have   been   issued   in   the   name   of   dead   person   on 21.11.2006.   It is the contention of the Petitioner that the Respondents cannot place reliance on the notice issued under Section 12(2) of the Act of 1894.   It is contended that the amount determined under the award was not offered to the claimant since 2001, when award was declared. There is no material to substantiate that amount was offered in 2001 and claimant has refused to accept amount.  Petitioner contends that since the notice is issued in the name of dead person that too in 2006, after lapse of five years from date of award, there is no question of acceptance or refusal to accept the amount of  compensation.   The notice has admittedly not Waghmare 3/11 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:24   :::                                  10.WP.10413.17.doc been served upon the legal heir of the deceased. 4 Apart   from   the   controversy   as   regards   offer   of   amount determined under the award by the Respondent­State, the award declared by the Collector on 31.10.2001 cannot be construed as an award in the eyes of law.  On perusal of the copy of the award, it appears that a notice within   contemplation   under   Section   4   was   published   in   Government Gazette and the same was published in the newspapers on 18 th  and 19th May 1999.   The declaration under Section 6 of the Land Acquisition Act has been issued on 04.10.1999 and the local publication of the declaration at   Tahsil   office   and   Talathi   Office   is   stated   to   have   been   made   on 16.11.1999.  The award is declared on 31.10.2001 within the time frame provided under Section 11(A) of the Land Acquisition Act.  In para 27 of the award it is recorded that the acquiring body has not taken the advance possession   of   the   land.     It   is   recorded   further   that   as   and   when   the acquiring body would  take  possession of   the  property  of   the   land,   the amount of compensation would be paid.  Though the award is declared on 31.10.2001,   admittedly   the  Respondents  have  not   taken  any   steps   for disbursing the amount of compensation until issuance of so called notice under Section 12(2) of the Act which has also been issued in the name of Waghmare 4/11 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:24   :::                                  10.WP.10413.17.doc dead person on 21.11.2006. It is pointed out that the possession of the acquired property has been taken over on 01.12.2006 though the Land Acquisition   Officer   declared   the   award   in   the   year   2001.     The compensation   determined   under   the   award   admittedly   has   not   been offered till 2006.  It is the case of the Petitioner that till today he has not received the amount of compensation. It appears that the Land Acquisition Officer  has  hastily  declared   the  award without  offering  the  amount  of compensation   on   31.10.2001   in   order   to   avoid   the   consequences   of lapsing of Land Acquisition proceedings in view of Section 11(A) of the Land Acquisition Act 1894.   Section 11(A) of  the Land Acquisition Act 1894 provides for the period within which an award shall be made.  It is provided that the Collector shall make an award under Section 11 within the period of two years from the date of publication of the declaration and if   no   award   is   made   within   that   period,   the   entire   proceeding   for acquisition of land shall  lapse.   In the instant matter, the date of local publication  of  declaration  under  Section  6   is   16.11.1999  and   in   view thereof   it  was  incumbent  for   the  Collector   to declare  the award up  to 15.11.2001.     In   the   instant   matter,   the   award   has   been   declared   on 31.10.2001 however, though the award is declared in the year 2001, the Waghmare 5/11 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:24   :::                                  10.WP.10413.17.doc amount  of   compensation  admittedly  has  not   even  been  offered   to   the claimants until November 2006.   It thus appeared that the Collector has made haste to declare the award in order to avoid the consequences of provisions of Section 11(A) of the Act which provides for lapsing of the proceedings.   A mere declaration of award without offer of the amount determined by  the Land Acquisition Officer  cannot  be construed as  an award within the meaning of provisions of Section 11 of the Act of 1894. Mere declaration of award in the year 2001 without offering amount of compensation admittedly for the period of six years atleast cannot be said to be a valid award within contemplation of provisions of Land Acquisition Act.    The award under the Land Acquisition Act   is  an offer which can either be accepted by the claimants and if they do not accept the same, they are entitled to claim enhanced value of the land by taking recourse to the   provisions   of   Section   18   of   the   Land   Acquisition   Act,   1894. Publication of the award without offering the amount of compensation as determined is not an award within meaning of Section 11 of the Act.   5 The Hon’ble Apex Court in the matter of Raja Harish Chandra Raj Singh vs. The Deputy Land Acquisition Officer and Anr.  reported in AIR 1961 Supreme Court page 1500 has interpreted the legal character of the Waghmare 6/11 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:24   :::                                  10.WP.10413.17.doc award made by the Collector under Section 12 in paragraph Nos.5 to 7 of the judgment.  The Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed thus : “5 In the dealing with this question it is relevant to bear in mind   the   legal   character   of   the  award  made  by   the  Collector under s. 12. In a sense it is a decision of the Collector reached by him after  holding an enquiry  as  prescribed  by  the Act.   It   is  a decision,   inter  alia,   in   respect  of   the  amount  of   compensation which   should  be  paid   to   the  person   interested   in   the  property acquired; but legally the award cannot be treated as a decision; it is in law an offer or tender of the compensation determined by the Collector to the owner of the property under acquisition. If the owner accepts the offer no further proceeding is required to be taken;   the   amount   is   paid   and   compensation   proceedings   are concluded.",

By this  petition,   the petitioner has challenged the order  dated 16/06/2017 and 02/01/2018 passed by the learned Tehsildar, Chiplun and learned Additional Collector, Ratnagiri respectively.   3.   The respondent no.1 claim to be in possession of land under Gat No.79   which   is   situated   towards   western   side   of   Gat   No.68.     The respondent claim that he has been using a passage passing through Gat 1/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   :::   P.H. Jayani                                       19 WP5896.18.doc No.68 and that the petitioner had obstructed the same by enclosing the Gat No.68 with a compound wall.  The respondent no.1 therefore filed an application under Section 5 of Mamlatdars Courts Act, 1906 seeking directions   against   the   petitioner   to   remove   obstructions   over   the passage in Gat No.68 of Post Kamathe, Chiplun, Dist. Ratnagiri and to restrain him from obstructing use of the said passage. 4. The learned Mamlatdar examined the respondent no.1 and his witnesses and by order dated 16/06/2017 allowed the application and directed the petitioner to remove the obstructions from the passage in Gat   No.68   and   further   restrained   him   from   creating   any   such obstruction and/or preventing the respondent no.1 from using the said passage.  The petitioner challenged the said order before the Additional Collector,   Ratnagiri.     The   Additional   Collector   dismissed   the   said revision application by order dated 02/01/2018.  Being aggrieved, the petitioner has filed the present Writ Petition.   5. Mr. Bakul Bhosale, learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the   petitioner   was   not   given   an   opportunity   to   cross   examine   the respondent   and   his   witnesses   and/or   to   adduce   his   evidence.     He submits   that   the   impugned   order   is   in   breach   of   the   principles   of 2/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   :::   P.H. Jayani                                       19 WP5896.18.doc natural justice.   6. Mr.  V.S.  Tadake,   learned counsel   for   respondent  no.1  submits that the petitioner had neither applied before the Mamlatdar for leave to   cross   examination   nor   had   he   raised   this   ground   before   the Additional Collector, Ratnagiri.   Having failed to do so, the petitioner cannot raise it as a ground of challenge.   The learned counsel for the respondent no.1 further submits that the petitioner has already filed a civil suit and the rights of the parties will be finally adjudicated in the said  suit.     In   the circumstances,   the  impugned cannot  be   interfered with in the writ jurisdiction.   7. The  short  point,  which   falls   for  determination,   is  whether   the impugned order is vitiated for breach of principles of natural justice.   8. It   is   to be noted that section 5   of   the Mamlatdar's  Court Act confers powers on the Mamlatdar   to address the grievances and give quick relief to agriculturists in relation to the land used for agriculture. Sub­section 1 of Section 5 reads thus :­ “ 5.  Powers of Mamlatdar's Courts. ­ (1)  Every Mamlatdar shall preside over a Court, which shall be called a Mamlatdar’s Court, and which shall, subject to the provisions of sections 6 and 26,have power, within such territorial limits as may from time to time be 3/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   :::   P.H.

Sub­section 2 of Section 5 confers powers on the Mamlatdar to issue injunction.   Sub­section 3 prescribes the period of limitation for filing of the suit under Section 5 of the Act and sub­section 4 of Section 5 relates to the cause of action. Sections 14 to 19 prescribe procedure to be followed by the Mamlatdar when the plaint is admitted.  Sections 15, 16 and 19 of the Act confer specific powers on the Mamlatdar to 4/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   :::   P.H.

It is thus evident that the Act specifically confers powers on the Mamlatdar to record evidence.  Hence, the Court presided over by the Mamlatdar, would be a 'Court' within the meaning of Section 3 of the Indian Evidence Act and provisions of Section 135, 136, 137 and 138 of   the   Indian  Evidence  Act  would  be  applicable   to   the  proceedings under Section 5 of Mamlatdars Court Act.   11. In the  instant case,   the records reveal  that the Mamlatdar has recorded statements of the respondent no.1 and his witnesses.  In view of applicability of the provisions of Section 135, 136, 137 and 138 of the   Indian Evidence  Act   to   the  proceedings  under  Section  5  of   the Mamlatdars Court Act, the petitioner had right to cross examine the respondent no.1 and his witnesses. The records reveal that the learned Mamlatdar  had not  given  an  opportunity   to   the  petitioner   to   cross examine the respondent no.1 and his witnesses.  Suffice it to say, right of cross examination being legal right, the petitioner was not required to   file   any   application   but   it   was   the   obligation   of   the   statutory authority recording the evidence to afford such opportunity.    In the 5/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   :::   P.H. Jayani                                       19 WP5896.18.doc instant case, no such opportunity was given.   12. It is well settled that no evidence affecting a party is admissible against that party unless the latter has had an opportunity of testing its truthfulness   by   cross   examination.   Under   the   circumstances,   the learned Mamlatdar was not justified in placing reliance on the evidence of   the   respondent   no.1   and   his   witnesses   without   giving   any opportunity of cross  examination.   The order passed by the  learned Mamlatdar is in breach of principles of natural justice.    13. The  issue raised  in   the petition being a pure  question of   law, which is not dependent on the determination of any question of fact and can be allowed to be raised at any stage of the litigation.  Hence, the   fact   that   the   petitioner   had   not   raised   this   ground   before   the learned Additional Collector would not prevent him from raising the said ground in this Writ Petition.   14. Under   the  circumstances  and  in  view of  discussion   supra,   the impugned orders cannot be sustained. Hence, the following order :­ (i) The petition is allowed. 6/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   :::   P.H.

(iii) The matter is remanded to the Mamlatdar with directions to give opportunity to the petitioner to cross examine the respondent no.1 and the   witnesses   examined   and   further   to   permit   him   to   adduce   his evidence. (iv) The learned Mamlatdar to decide the matter afresh on its own merits in accordance with law. (v) Parties   are   directed   to   appear   before   the   Mamlatdar   on 10/01/2019.   15. Rule is made absolute in the above terms.   (SMT. ANUJA PRABHUDESSAI, J.)  7/7 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/01/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:26   ::: ",

S. CHANDURKAR, J. ARGUMENTS HEARD ON : 27th NOVEMBER, 2018 JUDGMENT PRONOUNCED ON : 22nd DECEMBER, 2018 JUDGMENT :­ 1. This appeal under Section 173 of the Motor Vehicles Act,  1988   (for   short   'the   said  Act')   has   been  preferred  by   the insurer challenging the judgment dated 5th  August, 2006 passed by the learned Member, Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, Mumbai awarding compensation of Rs. 1,23,000/­ with interest at the rate 6%   p.a.   from   9th  January,   1998   till   its   recovery.   The   original claimant  has  filed cross  objections seeking enhancement  in   the amount   of   compensation   as   granted   to   the   extent   of Rs.10,37,000/­. 2. The facts in brief as pleaded in the claim application under Section 166 of the said Act are that on 17th August, 1987, when the claimant was proceeding on J.B. Road on his Scooter, a Lorry bearing No.MTT­1890 lost control and dashed the claimant's Scooter. The claimant suffered injuries as a result of said accident. The claimant was working as a Manager in an Automobile garage and as a result of the accident he suffered loss of earning due to   2 of 12    :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:27   ::: Shridhar Sutar                                                     3                               201-FA-374.07.doc said   accident.   It   was   pleaded   that   the   driver   of   Lorry   was responsible   for   causing   the   said  accident.  On   that  premise   the claimant   sought   grant   of   compensation   of   an   amount   of Rs.2,00,000/­with interest. The aforesaid proceedings were filed against the New India Assurance Company Limited. 3. The Motor Accident Claims Tribunal, by its judgment dated   22nd  March,   1995   granted   compensation   of   Rs.80,000/­ along  with   interest   at   the   rate  15% p.a.   to  be  payable   to   the claimant   as   compensation.   The   insurer,   however   moved   an application  for   setting aside  that  order  on the ground that   the vehicle in question was not insured with the said insurer. On 18 th September, 1995, the order dated 22nd March, 1995 was recalled and the claim petition was restored to file.  Thereafter, the present appellant   was   impleaded   as   party   and   it   participated   in   the proceedings before the Claims Tribunal. The parties thereafter led evidence and after considering the same the learned Member of the   Claims   Tribunal   partly   allowed   the   Claim   Petition   and awarded compensation of Rs.1,23,000/­ including the amount of no fault liability to be payable with interest at the rate 6% p.a. from 9th January, 1998 till recovery of that amount.    3 of 12    :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:27   ::: Shridhar Sutar                                                     4                               201-FA-374.07.doc 4. Being aggrieved by the aforesaid judgment, the insurer has filed this appeal.  The claimant not being satisfied with the amount   of   compensation   as   granted   has   filed   cross   objections seeking enhancement in the amount of compensation. 5. Shri Amol Gatne, the learned Counsel for the appellant submitted that the amount of compensation as awarded is on a higher   side   without   considering   the   evidence   on   record.   The disability certificate that was produced on record by the claimant dated   22nd  April,   1992   had   been   issued   merely   by   seeing   the previous medical papers of the claimant. In that certificate it was not stated that the Doctor issuing the said certificate had again examined  the  claimant.  Referring   to   the  deposition  of   the  said Doctor   at   Exhibit­28   it   was   submitted   that   according   to   said witness the fracture sustained by the claimant had recovered and he   could   not   identify   the   same.   No   permanent   disability   was suffered by the claimant nor was there any functional disability. It was thus submitted that the Claims Tribunal erred in accepting the disability certificate and by holding the disability to the extent of  25%.  The Claims Tribunal  was  not   justified  in  awarding  an amount   of   Rs.75,000/­   to   the   claimant   on   that   count.   The   4 of 12    :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:27   ::: Shridhar Sutar                                                     5                               201-FA-374.07.doc claimant continued in his employment even after the accident and his services were not terminated on account of the said disability. In absence of any evidence with regard to the probable future loss, the amount of Rs.75,000/­ awarded on that count was on a higher side. At the highest, it could be said that the claimant was entitled for some amount for a period of six months in that regard. The learned Counsel placed reliance on the decision in Raj Kumar Vs. Ajay Kumar ­ 2011(1) SCC 343  in support of this contention. It was   further  urged  that   the  compensation   could  not  have  been directed   to   be   paid   with   6%   interest   inasmuch   as   the   other Insurance   Company   had   already   deposited   the   amount   of compensation   in   the   Court.   It   was   thus   submitted   that   on   a re­consideration  of   the  evidence  on   record   it  was   clear   that   a higher amount of compensation had been awarded by the Claims Tribunal and the same was liable to be reduced. 6. Shri Moinuddin Ahmed Khan, the learned Counsel for the   respondent   No.1­claimant   while   supporting   the   impugned judgment submitted that the amount of compensation as awarded was on a lower side. He submitted that the claimant had placed on recored his salary certificate and he was receiving Rs.5000/­   5 of 12    :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:27   ::: Shridhar Sutar                                                     6                               201-FA-374.07.doc per   month   before   the   accident.   The   disability   certificate   at Exhibit­17   was   duly   proved   by   examining   the   Doctor   below Exhibit­28. The claimant was required to remain away from work for a period of six months. Similarly, he had to visit his Doctor on about  40 occasions  and he  referred  to   the  32 medical   receipts placed on record. According to him the Claims Tribunal did not consider   the   aspect   of   loss   of   future   income   in   its   proper perspective.  The amount  awarded on various  heads  were  on a lower side and on a proper appreciation of the evidence on record and by applying  the  correct   legal  principles,  an  amount  of  Rs. 10,37,000/­   was   liable   to   be   paid   towards   the   amount   of compensation. It was thus submitted that the appeal filed by the Insurance   Company   was   liable   to   be   dismissed   and   the   cross objections were liable to be allowed. 7. In   the   light   of   aforesaid   submissions   the   following points arise for consideration : (i) Whether  the  insurer  has proved that   the amount of compensation as granted is on a higher side? (ii) Whether   the   claimant   has   proved   that   the compensation as granted is lesser than the amount of just   compensation   and   that   the   amount   of compensation deserves to be enhanced?   6 of 12    :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:27   ::: Shridhar Sutar                                                     7                               201-FA-374.07.doc 8. I  have  heard   the   learned Counsel   for   the  parties  at length   and   I   have   also   perused   the   records   of   the   case.   The claimant examined himself at Exhibit­8. He deposed that while he was   proceeding   on   Scooter   a   rashly   driven   truck   dashed   him resulting in an accident. He received injuries on his right hand, head, face and leg. Initially, he was admitted at Sion Hospital and thereafter   he   was   removed   to   the   Parsi   General   Hospital.   He produced various bills   to  indicate medical  expenses.  He further stated that he spent Rs.1,500/­ towards expenses for the purposes of  Physiotherapy.  He was  thereafter  operated  for   removing  the plates and nails and he had also produced bills to that effect. He spent Rs.3000/­ to find out details of the offending vehicle.",

For the sake of  convenience and clarity  the parties are hereinafter   referred   to   in   the   capacity   in   which   they   were arrayed before the Tribunal.  5. Shorn of unnecessary details, the background facts can be summarised as under: a)  Applicant  no.1   is   the  Association   of   Sub­ordinate Service of Engineers. Applicant no.2 to 31 are the members of Applicant   no.1   Association.   The   applicants   were   initially appointed as 'Junior Engineers'.  Some of the applicants were recruited as 'Diploma­holder Junior Engineers'. The others fall in the category of 'unqualified Junior Engineers'.  b) On   16th  April,   1984,   the   Government   resolved   to confer the status of 'gazetted officers' upon the 'degree­holders' and other junior engineers. The degree­holder junior engineers were given the status of gazetted officers immediately. Whereas the   diploma­holder   and   unqualified   junior   engineers   were conferred the said status after putting in the specified years of service i.e. five years service for the junior engineers who had 6/32 :::   Uploaded on   - 07/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:28   ::: WP2605-17.DOC completed   three   years   diploma,   seven   years   for   two   years diploma­holders,   and   ten   years   for   the   unqualified   junior engineers.   Under   the   said   GR,   two   different   cadres   were created.   The   degree­holder   junior   engineers   were   designated “Assistant Engineer Grade­II”. Whereas the diploma­holder and unqualified   junior   engineers   were   designated   as   'Sectional Engineers'.  Both the cadres  i.e.  Assistant Engineers Grade­II and   Sectional   Engineers   were   given   the   same   pay­scale   i.e. Rs.600­30­750­40­950.    c) The   Government   introduced   Assured   Career Progression Scheme (“ACP Scheme”) vide GR dated 20th  July, 2001, to address, inter alia,  the issue of stagnation. By the said GR,   the   erstwhile   Time­Bound   Promotion   Scheme   (“TBP Scheme”)  was   repealed.  Vide  GR dated  11th  February,  2002, benefit  of   the said ACP Scheme came to  be extended to   the Section Engineers (applicants) after putting in 12 years service.",

The writ jurisdiction of this Court has been invoked by the petitioner through the present Writ Petition seeking a writ in the nature of mandamus for quashing and setting aside the impugned order   dated   09.11.2012   passed   by   the   Education   Officer.     The petitioner has also sought direction to the respondents­authorities to forward   his   pension   case   as   Headmaster   of   the   school   to   the Accountant General within a stipulated period and further direction is   also   sought   to   the   Accountant   General   to   ensure   that   the petitioner's   terminal   benefits   are   disbursed   forthwith,   in   the backdrop of his superannuation with effect from 01.12.2013. A brief narration of facts for effective adjudication of the matter in hand is necessary.   3. The petitioner has approached this Court by filing the present Writ Petition on 06.12.2012.  It is the case of the petitioner that   with   his   qualification   of   B.A.,   M.A.,   B.Ed.,   he   came   to   be appointed as Trained Graduate Teacher after regular selection with the school run by the Respondent No.3 with effect from 01.07.1980. The   petitioner   states   that   the   he   is   the   senior   most   teacher   in Category­C amongst the teaching staff and it is reflected so in the common   seniority   list   prepared   for   the   year   2007­2008.     The petitioner   has   placed   on   record   the   copy   of   the   seniority   list N.S. Kamble                                                                                          page 2 of 16 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:28   :::                                                                                      19-wp-636-2013 prepared by the Nutan Vidyalaya, Mangrul (Pan), Taluka­Akalkot, District­Solapur for the year 2007­2008. The   seniority   position   of   the   petitioner   came   to   be assailed by one Mr.Shetre and Smt.Kulkarni who were admittedly junior to the petitioner in the said list and Mr.Shetre approached this Court by filing Writ Petition No.4901 of 2008.   The Division Bench of   this  Court  directed  the  Education Officer   to  decide   the inter­se seniority in terms of Rule­12 of the Maharashtra Employees of Private Schools (Conditions of  Services) Regulations Act,  1977 and the Rules, 1981 (for short 'MEPS Act') between the petitioner and Mr.Shetre. In compliance of the directions issued by this Court, the Education Officer by an order dated 05.09.2008 was pleased to determine the said seniority and held that the petitioner is senior to Mr.Shetre as well as Smt.Kulkarni.  He concluded by observing that the petitioner came to be appointed from 01.07.1980 as a Trained Graduate  Teacher  and   therefore,   he  was   included   in  Category­C from the very same date.   However, in case of Shri.Shetre, though he was appointed on 16.06.1973 his appointment was in the D.Ed. scale and he acquired the qualification of B.A. in 1979 and B.Ed. in 1988.  Resultantly, he is placed in B.Ed. scale from 01.12.1988.  By applying   the   directives   contained   in   circular   dated   23.11.1983, Mr.Shetre was held to be eligible  for being placed  in Category­C N.S. Kamble                                                                                          page 3 of 16 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:28   :::                                                                                      19-wp-636-2013 from 16.06.1983  i.e.  after  10  years  of  his  appointment.     In  any contingency, we are not called upon to decide the issue of seniority of the petitioner as that has been put to rest by the orders passed by the   Education   Officer   which   were   confirmed   by   this   Court. However,  we  have  mentioned  said   fact   in  order   to  maintain   the chronology of events. 3. The decision of the Education Officer dated 05.09.2008 came   to   be   assailed   by   Mr.Shetre   by   instituting   a   Writ   Petition before   this   Court   which   came   to   be   numbered   as   Writ   Petition No.248 of 2009.  It is to be noted that the petitioner was issued an order   of   promotion   to   the   post   of   Headmaster   in   terms   of   his position   in   the   seniority   list  and   the  order  dated  15/24.05.2008 promoting  the  petitioner   to   the  post  of  Headmaster   is  placed on record   at   Annexure­C.   The   said   order   stipulates   that   as   the petitioner is promoted as Headmaster in the pay­scale of Rs.7500­ 25­12000   with   effect   from   01.06.2008.     When   this   order   was brought to the notice of the Division Bench of this Court, which was dealing with Writ Petition No.248 of 2009, the petition came to be disposed of with direction to Mr.Shetre, the petitioner therein to file an   appeal   before   the   School   Tribunal,   Solapur   challenging   his supercession.  Mr.Shetre filed an appeal before the School Tribunal N.S. Kamble                                                                                          page 4 of 16 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:28   :::                                                                                      19-wp-636-2013 and the School Tribunal by a detailed judgment dated 18.04.2011 was pleased to dismiss the Appeal No.30 of 2010 which was filed by him.   The issue of seniority of the petitioner, has thus been put to rest. 4. It is the case of the petitioner that in view of the dispute in the Management, which was not interested in giving promotion to   the  petitioner  notwithstanding   that  he  was   already   issued  an order of promotion to the post of Headmaster, the Education Officer was   persuaded   to   hand   over   the   charge   of   Headmaster   to Smt.Kulkarni by assigning her rights to sign the pay bills.  However, when the appeal of Mr.Shetre came to be dismissed by the School Tribunal, the Education Officer by order dated 03.08.2010 cancelled the right conferred on Smt.Kulkarni to sign the pay bills.  The order dated   03.08.2010   which   is   placed   on   record   at   Annexure­F, discloses   that   the   petitioner   was   promoted   to   the   post   of Headmaster with effect from 01.06.2008 and he is discharging his duty  in the said capacity since then.    However,   in  the meantime Smt.Kulkarni was given the authority to sign the pay bills and by the said   communication   the   Secretary   of   the   Society   in   which   the petitioner was working admitted that Shri.Potdar i.e. the petitioner is a regular Headmaster and a request was made to confer approval N.S. Kamble                                                                                          page 5 of 16 :::   Uploaded on   - 22/12/2018 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:36:28   :::                                                                                      19-wp-636-2013 to his appointment on permanent basis.",

By the impugned order the learned Judge had stayed the effect and implementation of the decision of cancelation of the Plaintiffs' membership of  Defendant No.1­Matunga Gymkhana, as communicated by letter dated 12th November 2018. 1/13 :::   Uploaded on   - 28/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   :::   P.H.

The   respondents   are   the   plaintiffs   in   the   suit   whereas   the appellant is the defendant and shall be hereinafter referred to as 'the plaintiffs' and 'the defendants' respectively. 4. The plaintiff  no.1 was enrolled as a member of  the defendant No.1­ Gymkhana pursuant to the application filed by his grandfather, who   is   a   life   member   of   the   defendant   No.1­Gymkhana.   The membership of the plaintiff no.1 was cancelled on 30/10/2018 mainly on the ground that the grandfather of the plaintiff no.1 had got him enrolled as a member by misrepresenting that the plaintiff no.1 was his son.   The   plaintiff   filed   a   suit   challenging   cancellation   of   his membership and by way of interim relief sought to stay the effect and implementation of the decision i.e. cancellation of his membership.   5. The learned Judge has granted the interim relief and stayed the effect   and   implementation   of   the  decision   taken  by   the  defendant­ Gymkhana to cancel   the membership of  the plaintiff,  mainly on the ground of breach of principles of natural justice, delay in taking action and further holding that the plaintiff no.1 cannot be compensated in terms of money.  2/13 :::   Uploaded on   - 28/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   :::   P.H. Jayani/pps.                                932(II) AOST3521.19.doc 6. Relying upon  the  decisions   in  T.P.  Daver v/s.  Lodge  Victoria [AIR 1963 SC 1144]  and  Royal Western India Turf Club Ltd. and Ors. v/s. Vinayak J. Gaekwad and Ors. [2006(6) Mh.L.J.665],  Mr. P.S. Dani, learned senior counsel for the defendant­gymkhana submits that the Civil Court would have no jurisdiction to review the decisions of   the   Defendant   No.­Gymkhana,     unless   the   action   is   without jurisdiction,   or   is   in   breach   of   principles   of   natural   justice   or   the order/action is malafide or is in bad faith. 7. Mr. P.S. Dani, learned senior counsel submits that the plaintiff no.1 was enrolled as a member on the basis of false information and hence in accordance with clause 2 of Chapter V of the Constitution, the defendant no.1­gymkhana was competent to cancel  his  membership. He submits that an unanimous resolution to cancel the membership of the plaintiff was taken  after issuing show cause notice to the plaintiff No.1   and   his   grandfather   and   after   giving   them   a   reasonable opportunity of being heard.  This decision was informed to the plaintiff no.1 vide letter dated 12/11/2018.   8. The   learned   senior   counsel  Mr.  Dani   further   submits   that   the defendant­club   had   learnt   about   the   said   false   and   incorrect 3/13 :::   Uploaded on   - 28/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   :::   P.H. Jayani/pps.                                932(II) AOST3521.19.doc information only after receipt of the KYM form dated 18/07/2018.  He, therefore, contends that there was no delay in initiating action against the plaintiff.   The learned counsel for the plaintiff submits that action against   the   plaintiff   no.1   has   been   taken   as   per   the   provisions contained   its   constitution,   after   complying   with   the   principles   of natural justice.   He, therefore, contends that the Trial Court was not justified in interefering with the decision of the defendant­club.   9. Mr. Gauraj Shah, learned counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the defendant­Gymkhana was in need of funds.   The then Managing Committee   had   told   Chandiram   Kishnani   that   the   defendant   ­ Gymkhana would shortly open membership to blood relatives to grand children of existing members and as such he could make an application to   enroll   the   plaintiff   no.1   as   a   member.     He   submits   that   the application   for  membership  of   the  plaintiff  no.1  was  proposed  and seconded  by     the   then   existing  members     of   the  defendant  no.1   ­ Gymkhana.     The   plaintiff   no.1   was   enrolled   as   a   member   and continued to be a member for a period of 22 years. The plaintiff had also furnished all the relevant information alongwith the documents to the defendant no.1 in the year 2003 and 2010. He submits that after a lapse of 22 years, the defendant  no.1, by notice dated 15/09/2018, for 4/13 :::   Uploaded on   - 28/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   :::   P.H. Jayani/pps.                                932(II) AOST3521.19.doc the first time, called upon the grand father of the plaintiff to establish his   relationship   with   the   plaintiff   no.1   and   by   notice   dated 15/10/2018, called upon the plaintiff no.1 and his grandfather to show cause as to why the membership of the plaintiff no.1 should not be cancelled.    He submits  that the plaintiff  no.1 was not enrolled as a member   on   the   basis   of   false   information  by   his   grandfather.     He contends that issuance of show cause notice was only an eye wash and that the decision to cancel the membership of the plaintiff no.1 was already taken in a resolution passed in a meeting held on 15/10/2018. 10. The   learned   counsel   for   the  plaintiff   further   submits   that   the defendant no.1­Gymkhana by letter dated 30/10/2018 had informed the plaintiff  no.1  that   the managing committee would consider  and take appropriate  action under  Chapter  5 of   the Constitution and  in accordance   with   the   rules   and   regulations   of   the   Gymkhana.     He submits that the plaintiff no.1 was not given any opportunity to show cause to the said letter dated 30/10/2018.  He submits that the action of the defendant no.1 is in breach of principles of natural justice.    11. The learned counsel for the plaintiff further contends that in view of the scheme introduced on 28th April, 1996, the plaintiff no.1, being 5/13 :::   Uploaded on   - 28/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   :::   P.H. Jayani/pps.                                932(II) AOST3521.19.doc the   grandson   of   a   life   member,   was   entitled   to   be   enrolled   as   a member.  He submits that the error, if any, in the previous application had been rectified by the grandfather of the plaintiff no.1 by filing an application to enroll the plaintiff no.1 as a member of the Gymkhana as per the amended scheme.  He submits that the appellant – Gymkhana has not taken any decision on the said application.  He further submits that the plaintiff no.1 had been enjoying the facilities of the club since last   22   years,   and   hence   the   learned   trial   Judge   was   justified   in restoring   the   status   quo   existing   prior   to   the   cancellation   of   the membership. 12. I   have   perused   the   records   and   considered   the   submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the respective parties.   13. At the outset it may be mentioned that in T.P. Devar (supra) the Apex Court has observed that the source of the power of associations like clubs and lodges to expel  their  members  is   the contract  on the basis  of  which they become members.    The Apex Court  has  further observed   that   this   contractual   origin   of   rule   of   expulsion   has   its corollary in the cognate rule that in expelling a member the conditions laid down in the rules must be strictly complied with.     It   is  further 6/13 :::   Uploaded on   - 28/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   :::   P.H. Jayani/pps.                                932(II) AOST3521.19.doc observed that a jurisdiction of a civil court to interfere with the decision of such associations is rather limited;  it cannot obviously sit as a court of appeal from decisions of such a body; it can set aside the order of such a body, if the said body acts without jurisdiction or does not act in good faith or acts in violation of the principles of natural justice.  These principles have been reiterated in a  Royal Western India Turf Club Ltd. (supra) .   14. In the instant case, it is not in dispute that Prakash Kishnani and Chandiram Kishnani, the father and grandfather of the plaintiff no.1, were   the   life   members   of   the   defendant   no.1   ­   Gymkhana.",

The Petitioner   is concerned with resolution no. 2551, by which the decision   was taken to cancel  the contract    of South Area which was   allotted to the petitioner.   On   02.05.2018,   a   resolution   was   passed   by   the standing committee to issue a fresh tender  by dividing  the city into eight zones.  In pursuance of the said resolution,   on 15th September,   2018,     fresh   tenders   were   floated   by   the Respondent No.2 ­Corporation for collection and transportation of the garbage by dividing the city in four parts.  The petitioner preferred   representation  on 05th October, 2018,  reducing the tonnage   rate   to   Rs.   1570/­   metric   tonne   and   the   standing committee on 9th October, 2018, passed  a resolution vide No. 3314,  by  which   it   cancelled   its  earlier     resolution  no.  2551 dated 11.04.2018.   It also   cancelled earlier     resolution   no. 2626 dated 02.05.2018, by which it  had resolved to  issue a fresh tender and by the said resolution, the standing committee stayed the E­tender issued on 15.09.2018.  The said   resolution of the Standing Committee provided for complete redressal of petitioners   grievance.     Further,   on  12.10.2018,   a   letter  was addressed   by  the PCMC/ Respondent  No.2,     requesting the petitioner     to   submit   his   concurrence     to   the   resolution no.3314 passed by the Standing Committee on 09.10.2018 and accordingly,   on   15.10.2018,   the   petitioner   submitted   its acceptance.  It is the case of the petitioner  that  then, all of a Borey                        5/38 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 12/02/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/03/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   ::: spb/                    WP13820-18-j-r-2.doc sudden,   on   31.10.2018,   the   Respondent   No.3   i.e.   The Municipal   Commissioner   of   PCMC   passed   an   order   to implement       the  cancelled   resolution    nos.  2551,  2552 and 2626 and to continue with the   tender process  initiated   on 15.09.2018.   It   is  a specific  case of  the petitioner that he was made aware   of the said   decision   only   when the affidavit came to be  tendered in writ petition  no. 3219 of 2018 which was filed  by one Mr. Moreshwar Madhu Bhondve,  challenging the award  of contract in  favour of the petitioner.   8 It is in sequence of these events, the petitioner   is aggrieved   by   the   action     of   Respondent   No.3­Municipal Commissioner   and   has   assailed   the   said   action   as   being arbitrary, being arrived   at   without following   due procedure of law.   The petition   assails   the said action   on the premise that in pursuance     of the Tender No. 10/2017­18, a contract was   executed     by   the   PCMC   with   the   petitioner     and   this contract     was   concluded     one.     Abruptly,     the   standing committee      took a decision,  not   to   give effect   to   the said contract   and     fresh tenders came to be floated, however, on the   grievance   being   raised   by   the   petitioner,   the   standing committee   passed resolution no. 3314, cancelling  its  earlier decision   and   in   fact   the   petitioner     was   asked   to   give   his consent   to act in terms   of the said resolution but suddenly there was a turn around, resulting in refraction of the earlier Borey                        6/38 This Order is modified/corrected by Speaking to Minutes Order dated 12/02/2019 :::   Uploaded on   - 09/03/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:32   ::: spb/                    WP13820-18-j-r-2.doc course   of   action   and   the   fresh   process   initiated   is   carried forward  by   cancelling   process   emanating   from  Tender    No. 10/2017­18.   This action   is condemned by the petitioner as arbitrary   and   in   utter   derogation   of   the   principles   of administrative law and the principles of estoppel is pressed in service and the petitioner  seeks a relief of issuance of direction to   the   PCMC     to   implement   standing   committee   resolution no.3314   by   quashing   and   setting   aside   the   decision   of   the PCMC to proceed with the subject tender  process.  9 In support of the petition,   we have heard learned senior   counsel Dr. Sathe.",

The said  Mr.Haji Ali Mohammed Haji Cassum died on 7th November,1946. After the death of the said  Mr.Haji Ali Mohammed Haji Cassum, his legal  heirs  filed administrative suit  bearing no.3415 of  1947 in this court for the administration of the entire estate of the said  Mr.Haji Ali Mohammed Haji Cassum. 3. By an order dated 30th June, 1950, this court appointed the court receiver in the said suit as receiver of the property of the said Mr.Haji Ali Mohammed Haji Cassum with all powers under Order XL Rule 1(d) of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908.  This court by an order dated 25th November, 1952 allowed the court receiver to sell the land :::   Uploaded on   - 05/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:35   ::: kvm 6 WP5539.17 admeasuring  about  644  Acre  situated  at  Village  Dahisar,  Taluka Borivali by public auction. 4. It  is  the case of  the petitioner that  pursuant  to  the said order passed by this court, the court receiver conducted an auction on 29th March,1962 and confirmed the sale in favour of Mr.K.Lalchand on 30th March,1962 in respect  of  the said  land admeasuring 644 Acre. Mr.K.Lalchand on behalf of the petitioner participated in the said bid and submitted the highest bid in the sum of Rs.13,50,000/-. 5. On 29th March,1962, the court receiver submitted a report before this court and prayed that the court receiver be authorized to accept  the said  offer  of  Rs.13,50,000/-  on the terms and conditions mentioned in the said offer letter and to complete the sale in favour of the said Mr.K.Lalchand and/or his nominee or nominees.  By an order dated  30th March,1962,  this  court  allowed and  authorized  the  court receiver  to  accept  the  offer  of  Mr.K.Lalchand  for  the  sum  of Rs.13,50,000/- for the entire land admeasuring 644 Acres situated at Village Dahisar and further directed to complete the sale of the said property  in  favour  of  the  auction  purchaser  and/or  his nominee/nominees.   It  is  the  case  of  the  petitioner  that  the  said Mr.K.Lalchand deposited the said amount with the court receiver in respect of the purchase of the said Dahisar land inclusive of the suit property. 6. It is the case of the petitioner that after demise of the said Mr.K.Lalchand, this court by an order dated 29th July, 1970 authorized :::   Uploaded on   - 05/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:35   ::: kvm 7 WP5539.17 the court receiver to execute one or more conveyances in respect of the said lands at Dahisar in the name of nominee/s and the legal heirs of the said Mr.K.Lalchand to be joined as confirming parties. 7. In the meanwhile Mr.Bhalchandra D.Patil and others i.e. respondent nos.  1 to 6 herein claiming to be the tenants of the suit property filed a tenancy application under section 32G of the Bombay Tenancy and Agricultural Land Act, 1948 before the learned Tahsildar and Agricultural Land Tribunal, Borivali in respect of the suit property inter  alia  praying for  their  declaration as tenants  and for  fixing the purchase  price  of  the  suit  property.   On  29th July,  1970,  the  court receiver  executed  about  144  conveyances.  It  is  the  case  of  the petitioner  that  the  formal  conveyance  for  various  survey  numbers including suit land is still pending due to various litigations between the parties. 8. Sometime in the year 1970, the respondent no.1 and the predecessor  of  the  respondent  nos.  2  to  6  jointly  filed  tenancy application against the court receiver and  Mr.Haji Ali Mohammed Haji Cassum claiming to be tenants of 2 Acre and 20 Gunthas land adjacent to the suit property.   9. On 9th November, 1970 the learned Additional Tahsildar recorded  the  statement  of  the  respondents  wherein  the  respondents submitted  that  they  had  no  other  land  except  the  one  which  was mentioned  in  the  then  tenancy  application  and  obtained  the  32M certificate of the MTAL Act in their favour. :::   Uploaded on   - 05/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:35   ::: kvm 8 WP5539.17 10.

The respondent nos. 1 to 6 are claiming to be the legal  heirs of  the said  Ms.Chauthubai Dharman Patil.  The name of the respondent nos. 1 to 6  appeared for the first time  in  the  mutation  entry  no.  2030  and  4026  dated  20 th December,1960 and 6th May, 1968 respectively as legal  heirs of the said  Ms.Chauthubai Dharman Patil. 11. It is the case of the petitioner that sometime in the year 1959, the said Tahsildar initiated suo-motu formal enquiry bearing no. TNC/32G/18/59 under the provisions of MTAL Act which proceedings were subsequently dropped in view of the fact that the suit property was in custody of the court receiver.  In the year 1978, the learned Tahsildar again initiated  suo-motu proceedings under section 32G of the MTAL Act vide case no.106 of 1978. 12. On 12th October, 1978, the petitioner preferred an appeal before the learned Sub-Divisional Officer against the said order passed by  the  learned  Tahsildar.   The  said  appeal  however  came  to  be dismissed by the learned Sub-Divisional Officer on the ground that no appeal against the   interim order of the suo-motu passed by the learned Tahsildar  was  maintainable.",

With a view to appreciate the legal and factual submissions, a brief reference to the factual aspects will be necessary.  1 of 20 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:38   ::: 2   wp-9844.18.docx 2 The  petitioner   is   in   the   service  of   the  Government  of Maharashtra.   On   17th  November   2015,   the   State   Government transferred the petitioner from the post of the Deputy Collector   of Rationing, G­ Zone, Mumbai to the post of the Sub­Divisional Officer, Bhiwandi,   District   Thane.   Before   completion   of   normal   tenure   of three years,   the State Government passed an order dated 7th  June 2018 by which he was transferred to the post of Deputy Collector (Land Acquisition No.4), Mumbai Suburban District. In fact, by the Government   order  dated  7th  June   2018,   transfer   of   three  officers including the present petitioner was made admittedly in purported exercise   of   powers   under   sub­section   (5)   of   section   4   of   the Maharashtra   Goverment   Servants   Regulation   of   Transfer   and Prevention of  Delay  in Discharge of  Official  Duties  Act,  2005 (for short “the said Act of 2005”). Under the said order dated 7th  June 2018, as stated earlier, the petitioner was transferred from the post of Sub­Divisional   Officer,   Bhiwandi   in   District   Thane   to   the   post   of Deputy Collector (Land Acquisition No.4), Mumbai Suburban District which was the post occupied by one Smt. Archana Kadam (the third respondent herein). The second respondent – Mohan Naladkar who was holding the post of Sub­Divisional Officer, Wada, District Palghar was   transferred   to   the   post   of   Sub­Divisional   Officer,   Bhiwandi, District  Thane held earlier  by the petitioner.  The third respondent was posted as Sub­Divisional Officer, Wada District, Palghar which was the post earlier held by the second respondent. The challenge in the Original Application No.515 of 2018 filed by the petitioner before the   Maharashtra   Administrative   Tribunal   (for   short   “the   said Tribunal”) was to the said order of transfer dated 7th June 2018. 2 of 20 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:38   ::: 3   wp-9844.18.docx 3 The first respondent – State Government filed a reply of Shri   Santosh   Vitthal   Gawade.   The   stand   taken   by   the   State Government is set out in paragraphs 3 to 6. The said paragraphs 3 to 6 read thus :­ “3. I further submit that this Hon’ble Tribunal vide the aforesaid order dated 13.6.2018 in paragraph 4 has been pleased to observe that the Applicant following the   impugned   transfer  order  has  handed  over   the charge to Respondent No.2 and Respondent No.2 has joined   at   his   place.   In   other   words,   the   order   of transfer   has   been  duly   effected   and   implemented. Record   further   reveals   that   the   Applicant   having been relieved from the post of Sub­Divisional Officer, Bhiwandi, District Thane has not yet complied with the order of transfer dated 7.6.2018 as, the Applicant has not joined his duties at the place of transfer viz. Dy.   Collector   (Land   Acquisition),   No.4,   Mumbai Suburban. 4. I   respectfully   say   and   submit   that   the   order   of transfer   dated   7.6.2018   has   been   issued   in consonance with the provisions of ROTA­2005 and the order impugned adheres   to the various orders issued by the Hon’ble Apex Court as well as by this Hon’ble   Tribunal   in   the   context   of   judgement rendered   by   the   Hon’ble   Apex   Court   in   TSR Subramaniam   &   Ors.   Vs.   Union   of   India   &   Ors. Decided on 31.10.2003 and followed by the circular issued   by   the   Highest   Competent   Authority,   as quoted on page no.46 of   the  Original  Application. Procedure   so   followed   in   compliance   with   the aforesaid   judgment   rendered  by   the  Hon’ble  Apex Court is mentioned hereinbelow. 5. I say and submit that the proposal of transfer and posting of 4 officers was prepared and approved by   the   Civil   Services   Board.   The   names   of   the present Applicant as well as names of Respondent Nos.2 and 3 did not figure therein. Pursuant to the   statutory   provisions   incorporated   under ROTA­2005   read   with   the   aforesaid   judgment 3 of 20 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:38   ::: 4   wp-9844.18.docx rendered by the Hon’ble Apex Court, the proposal approved by CSB was placed before the Hon’ble Minister   holding   the   portfolio   of   Revenue Department for approval. The Hon’ble Minister in pursuance of power and authority conferred upon him,   effected   certain   modifications   in   the proposal   prepared   by   Civil   Services   Board. Accordingly,   in   public   interest   the   Hon’ble Revenue Minister recorded specific  observations as regards in so far as the transfer and posting of the   present   Applicant   and   that   of   Respondent No.2. It is recorded that the post of Dy. Collector (Land Acquisition)  No.4,  Mumbai  Suburban has become vacant  and  the  same  is   required   to  be filled.  At   the   same,   in  so   far  as   the  posting  of Respondent   No.2   is   concerned,   the   Hon’ble Revenue  Minister   specifically  observed   that   the Applicant is due for transfer in November 2018 and   it   is   essential   to   give   priority   to   ongoing project  viz.  Nagpur­Mumbai Samrudhi Highway. Accordingly,   in   public   interest   and   on administrative   grounds,   the   Hon’ble   Revenue Minister decided to post Respondent No.2 in the post   occupied   by   the   Applicant.   In   so   far   as Respondent   No.3   is   concerned,   the   Hon’ble Minister   specifically   observed   that   the   post   of Sub­Divisional   Officer,   Wada,   District   Palghar, which   has   become   vacant   consequent   upon transfer   of   Respondent   No.2   is   required   to   be filled in. Hereto annexed and marked as EXHIBIT ‘AR­1’  is   the   copy  of  proposal  of  Civil  Services Board   and   the   decision   taken   by   the   Hon’ble Revenue Minister. 6. I   say   and   submit   that   in   consonance   with   the statutory provisions, the aforesaid proposal was placed  before   the  Highest  Competent  Authority i.e.   the   Hon’ble   Chief   Minister.   The   Highest Competent   Authority   approved   the   aforesaid proposal.   Hereto   annexed   and   marked   as EXHIBIT ‘AR­2’  is the copy of approval rendered by the Hon’ble Chief Minister.” (emphasis added)  4 of 20 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:38   ::: 5   wp-9844.18.docx 4 Copies   of   the   notings   signed   by   various   government authorities  were  annexed  to   the  affidavit.  The  second  respondent filed a reply  in which a contention was raised that the provisions incorporated   in   the   said   Act   of   2005   are   regulatory   and   not prohibitory.   It   was   submitted   that   a   discretion   is   vested   in   the authorities   of   the   first   respondent   to   make   exception   whenever special   circumstances   exist.   The   third   respondent   relied   upon   a decision  of   the  Division  Bench   of   this  Court   in   the   case  of  V.B. Gadekar Vs.  Maharashtra Housing and Area Development Authority and  Anr.1.  The  petitioner   filed   rejoinder   to   the  affidavit   in   reply. There   is   an  additional   reply  of  Shri  Santosh  V.  Gawade   filed  on behalf of the State Government essentially for relying upon a letter received from the Election Commission of India.  5 By   the   impugned   order   dated   7th  August   2018,   the original application preferred by the petitioner was dismissed. The reasons given by the learned Member of the Tribunal for rejecting the contentions of the petitioner can be summarised as under :­ A] As the impugned order provided for mid­term transfer, obviously Civil  Services  Board (for  short  “CSB”) did not  have   the  names  who  were   short   of   completing three  years  as  per   the  provisions  of   the  said Act  of 2005; B] After   noticing   the   omission   and   realizing   the importance of completing  ‘Samrudhi Project’  without any   difficulties,   the   name   of   the   petitioner   was 1 (2008) 2 Mh.L.J. 640 5 of 20 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:38   ::: 6   wp-9844.18.docx mentioned   in   the   proposal   and   approved   by   the Hon’ble Minister; C] The   Hon’ble   the   Chief   Minister   approved   the   said proposal of the Hon’ble Minister and  D] The   Competent   Authority   has   mentioned   special reasons for the mid­term transfer of the petitioner.  6 We may note here that this petition was heard for some time by the earlier Bench. By order dated 11th  September 2018, a prima   facie   finding   was   recorded   by   the   said   Bench   that   the impugned order of transfer was illegal.",

DATE : 1st FEBURARY, 2019. JUDGMENT: Heard Mr. Joshi, learned Counsel for the petitioners and Ms. Khan, learned Counsel for the respondent at length. 2. By this Petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India, the petitioners,   hereinafter   referred   to   as   “defendants'   have   challenged   the judgment  and decree dated 20th  December,  1997 passed by the   learned  IV Extra Joint District Judge, Pune in Civil Appeal No.882 of 1995. By that order, the  learned District  Judge allowed  the appeal  preferred by the respondent, hereinafter after referred to as 'plaintiff' and set aside the judgment and decree dated  11th  August,  1995  passed  by   the   learned  II  Additional  Small  Causes Judge, Pune in Regular Civil Suit No.1186 of 1990. The learned District Judge decreed the suit and directed the defendants to deliver vacant and peaceful possession of     two rooms admeasuring 18'x39'  square meters  in Amirchand Chawl situate at C.S. No.24A, Bopodi, more particularly described in paragraph 1 of 6 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:43   :::       903­wp­1964­1998.odt 1 of the plaint.  The relevant and material facts, that are necessary for disposal of the present Petition, briefly stated, are as under. 3. The plaintiff instituted suit against the defendants for recovery of possession, inter alia, alleging that defendant No.1 remained in arrears of rent and other  charges   from 1st  June,  1980.  The plaintiff   issued demand notice terminating tenancy of  defendant  No.1 and called upon defendant  No.1  to comply with the demands made therein. Defendant No.1 gave reply on 29 th January, 1989 and denied the contents of the notice. On 11th September, 1990, the  plaintiff   instituted   the   suit  alleging  that  defendant  No.1  is  a  defaulter; defendant   No.1   had   sublet   the   suit   premises   to   defendants   No.2   and   3; defendant No.1 has made permanent construction (ota)  in front of the suit premises; defendant No.1 has been causing nuisance and annoyance to the plaintiff and other occupiers and that the plaintiff requires the suit premises reasonably and bona fide. The plaintiff had thus instituted the suit invoking grounds under section 12, 13 (1) (e), 13 (1) (b), 13 (1) (c) and 13 (1) (g) of the Bombay Rents, Hotel and Lodging House Rates Control Act, 1947 (for short 'Act'), The defendant filed written statement at Exhibit 11 and resisted the suit. On the basis of the pleadings of the parties, the learned trial Judge framed the necessary  issues.  By order dated 11th  August,  1995,  the learned trial  Judge dismissed the suit. Aggrieved by that decision, the plaintiff preferred appeal. By the impugned order, the learned District Judge has allowed the appeal. 4. In support of this Petition, Mr. Joshi submitted that the learned District Judge decreed the suit only on the ground of unlawful subletting. The learned District Judge held that the plaintiff proved that defendant No.1 had unlawfully sublet   the  suit  premises   to  defendants  No.2 and 3.  The  learned District Judge decreed the suit only under section 13 (1) (e) of the Act and declined   to   pass   decree   on   other   grounds.  He   submitted   that   the   learned 2 of 6 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:43   :::       903­wp­1964­1998.odt District Judge did not appreciate the ingredients to prove unlawful subletting. Mr. Joshi relied on the decision of Nirmal Kanta  Vs. Ashok Kumar, (2008) 7 Supreme   Court   Cases   722  and   in   particular   paragraph   16   thereof.   In paragraph 16,   the  Apex  Court  observed  that  a   sub­tenancy  or  a   subletting comes into existence when the tenant  inducts  a third party stranger to the landlord into the tenanted accommodation and parts with possession thereof wholly  or   in  part   in   favour  of   such   third  party  and puts  him  in  exclusive possession thereof.  The lessor and/or a landlord seeking eviction of a lessee or tenant   alleging   creation   of   a   sub­tenancy   has   to   prove   such   allegation   by producing proper evidence to that effect. He has taken me though the findings recorded by the learned District Judge on the ground of unlawful subletting. 5. On the other hand, Ms. Khan submitted that she has not received any instructions from the plaintiff. 6. I   have   considered   the   rival   submissions   advanced   by   learned Counsel   for   the   parties.   I   have   also   perused   the   material   on   record.   As mentioned earlier, the plaintiff had invoked grounds under section 12, 13 (1) (b), 13 (1) (c), 13(1) (e) and 13 (1) (g) of the Act. The learned trial Judge dismissed   the   suit.  The District   Judge allowed  the  appeal  preferred by  the plaintiff only under section 13 (1) (e) of the Act. Ms. Khan did not advance any submissions supporting eviction decree on the grounds under section 12, 13 (1) (b), 13 (1) (c) and 13 (1) (g) of the Act. Thus, only question that requires to be examined is whether the plaintiff has established that defendant No.1 has unlawfully sublet the suit premises to defendants No.2 and 3. 7. In the case of  Joginder Singh Sodhi Vs. Amar Kaur, (2005) 1 Supreme Court  Cases  31,   the  Apex  Court  has   referred   to   the  decision  of Associated  Hotels  of   India  Ltd Vs.  S.B.  Sardar  Ranjit  Singh,  AIR  1968 3 of 6 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:43   :::       903­wp­1964­1998.odt Supreme Court 933. In this case, the Apex Court held that in a suit of landlord for eviction of tenant on the ground of subletting, the landlord has to prove by leading evidence; (a) a third party was found to be in exclusive possession of the  rented property; (b) parting   of   possession   thereof   was   for   a   monetary   consideration. This settled principle was reiterated by the Apex Court from time to time.  8. In the case of  Shama Prashant Raje Vs. Ganpatrao, (2000) 7 Supreme Court Cases 522,  it was held that   two ingredients namely parting with possession and monetary consideration thereof have to be established. The Apex Court also referred decision of  Bharat Sales Ltd Vs. LIC of India, (1998)  3  Supreme Court  Cases  1,  where   it  was  observed  that   subletting comes   into   existence   when   the   tenant   gives   possession   of   the   tenanted accommodation,   wholly   or   in   part   and   puts   another   person   in   exclusive possession thereof. In the case of Joginder Singh Sodhi (supra), in paragraph 17,   the  Apex  Court  also  observed  that   since  payment  of   rent  or  monetary consideration may have been made secretly,   the law does not require such payment to be proved by affirmative evidence and the court is permitted to draw its own inference upon the facts of the case proved at the trial, including the delivery of exclusive possession to infer that the premises were sublet. 9. In   case  of  Nirmal  Kanta  (supra),   the  Apex  Court   observed   in paragraph 16 thus; “What constitutes sub­letting has repeatedly fallen for the consideration of this Court in various cases and it is now well­established that a sub­tenancy or a subletting comes into   existence   when   the   tenant   inducts   a   third   party stranger to the landlord into the tenanted accommodation and   parts   with   possession   thereof   wholly   or   in   part   in 4 of 6 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:43   :::       903­wp­1964­1998.odt favour   of   such   third   party   and   puts   him   in   exclusive possession thereof.  The  lessor and/or a  landlord seeking eviction of  a  lessee or  tenant alleging creation of  a sub­ tenancy has to prove such allegation by producing proper evidence to that effect. Once, it is proved that the lessee and/or tenant has parted with exclusive possession of the demised   premises   for   a   monetary   consideration,   the creation   of   a   sub­tenancy   and/or   the   allegation   of   sub­ letting stands established”. 10. In  the  present  case,   the   learned District  Judge has  observed  in paragraph 11 that the suit premises was originally let out to one Yesammabai. The plaintiff claimed that defendant No.1 Parubai was no way related to the original tenant. Since she was residing with the original tenant, the plaintiff recognized her as a tenant. The plaintiff alleged that defendant No.1 has sublet the   suit   premises   to   defendants   No.2   and   3   who   are   no   way   related   to defendant No.1. The learned District Judge thereafter observed, “admittedly all the 3 defendants are residing in the suit premises”. The question is whether the plaintiff  has  proved  one  of   the   ingredients  of   subletting.  A  perusal  of   the impugned order does not show that the learned District Judge recorded any finding as regards satisfaction of one of the ingredients of unlawful subletting. Before passing decree on the ground of subletting, it is necessary to record a finding to the effect that third party was found to be in exclusive possession of the rented premises. In the present case, no such finding is recorded by the learned   District   Judge.   In   view   thereof,   the   impugned   order   cannot   be sustained and as such  is   liable  to be set aside. The appeal  will  have to be restored to the file of the learned District Judge. The learned District Judge will consider the evidence on record and record finding on the question of unlawful subletting keeping in mind the principles laid down in the above case. 11. In  the  result,   the  Petition succeeds.  The  impugned order   is   set aside. Civil Appeal No.882 of 1995 is restored to the file of the learned District 5 of 6 :::   Uploaded on   - 04/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:32:43   :::       903­wp­1964­1998.odt Judge.

Heard by consent of parties. 2] Petitioner  has  approached   this  Court   being   aggrieved  by   the Order dated  11/9/2014, thereby rejecting the claim of the Petitioner of belonging to the Mahar Scheduled Caste.   Petitioner's claim was rejected   on   the   short   ground   that,   since   the   Petitioner   originally belonged to the State of Karnataka, he is not entitled to be treated as belonging to Scheduled Caste in the State of Maharashtra. 3] The issue is no more  res intergra.     The Hon'ble Apex Court in the case of  Sudhakar Vithal Kumbhare Vs. State of Maharashtra1, has 1 (2004) 9 SCC 481 : 2004(5) ALL MR 152 2/4 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:25   ::: (905)-WP-3425-15.doc held that if a person migrates and both,  the place from where he has migrated and the place where he is migrated, form part of the same State prior to re­organization but after re­organization  the said areas belong to different States, then merely on the ground of migration, candidate cannot be denied the claim of social status.   4]   Undisputedly,   prior   to   re­organization,   Taluka   Chikkodi   in Belgaum   District   to   which   the   Petitioner   originally   belongs   and Kolhapur which is  the place where the Petitioner is migrated,  both were the parts of erstwhile State of Bombay.  After re­organization of the States, Chikkodi in Belgaum District became  a part of the State of Karnataka   whereas   Kolhapur   District   became   the   State   of Maharashtra.       Undisputedly,   the   Caste   “Mahar”   is   recognized   as Scheduled Caste in the State of Karnataka as well as in the State of Maharashtra.   In that view of the matter, rejection of the claim of the Petitioner on the said ground is not tenable.      The matter needs to be reconsidered by the Scrutiny Committee on its own merits 4] The impugned order is therefore quashed and set aside.    The matter   is   remitted   to   the   Respondent   –   Scrutiny   Committee   for 3/4 :::   Uploaded on   - 06/02/2019 :::   Downloaded on   - 29/05/2019 23:33:25   ::: (905)-WP-3425-15.doc considering the claim of the Petitioner in the light of the aforesaid observations. 5] Rule is made absolute accordingly with no order as to costs.

Mr. Sarvesh Chandra, advocate appearing for respondent Board  says that the impugned order namely letter ref no. PNGRB/NGPL/05/2007  dated December 10, 2007 is not a decision of the Board and therefore,  the order  is not appealable.  The impugned letter is signed by Mr. Ramesh  Samtani, Officer on Special duty (in short OSD) with the Petroleum and  Natural Gas Regulatory Board (P&NGRB).  Mr. Sarvesh Chandra says that  the OSD was not authorized to write this letter and to return the  application of the appellant. Accordingly, P&NGRB does not own this  impugned letter.  The same is the situation with other three earlier letters  nos. PNGRB/CGD/18/2007/1/1, PNGRB/CGD/20/2007/3 and  PNGRB/CGD/19/2007/2 all dated November 28, 2007.  Therefore, the only  interpretation of this statement that these three letters non est in the eyes  Deepak    1 Deepak    2 of law, and as a consequence, there is no option but to say that  applications made before P&NGRB are still pending.  The respondent is therefore, directed to dispose of the four  applications which were returned with the four letters dated December  10, 2007 and November 28, 2007 mentioned above, as early as possible in  accordance with law.

Bajaj, Technical Member    These appeals were heard by Hon’ble IInd Bench of this  Appellate Tribunal consisting of the Hon’ble Technical Member  (Hon’ble Mr. A.A. Khan) and Hon’ble Judicial Member ( Hon’ble  Mrs. Justice Manju Goel).      2.  Hon’ble Mr. A.A. Khan, Technical Member and Hon’ble  Mrs. Justice Manju Goel, Judicial Member issued an Order  under Section 123 of The Electricity Act, 2003, which, inter  alia,  gives points of divergence culled out by both the Hon’ble  Members at para 11 & 12 of their Order dated 25th October,  2007.  It is considered necessary to give below the order of the  two Hon’ble Members:       Order under section 123 of Electricity Act 2003     “The two appeals viz. the appeal Nos. 26/2007 &  36/2007 arise out of the same impugned order viz the one  dated 08 Feb. 2007 passed on a petition filed by the Noida  ICS  No. of corrections           Page 3 of 23  Appeal no. 26/07 & appeal No. 36/07  Power Company Ltd (NPCL for short). The detailed facts of the  case are available in the two judgments of the two members of  the bench. For the purpose of the present order under section  123 Electricity Act 2003, we need to place only the basic facts.         2. NPCL contracted to purchase 10 MW of power from UPPCL on  marginal cost. The UPPCL commenced supply of 10 MW w.e.f.  10 May 2006 and raised the bill for this supply for the first time  in September 2006. Subsequently in November 2007 UPPCL  revised the bill. The NPCL found the rate charged being higher  than its expectations and defaulted in paying the bill. UPPCL  vide its letter dated 04 Nov. 2001 threatened to discontinue the  additional supply of power and restrict the power supply to the  original 45 MW for which the parties had an existing power  purchase agreement. This led to filing a petition No.414 by  NPCL to UPERC under Section 86 of the Electricity Act 2003 and  Section 34 of the U.P. Electricity Reforms Act 1999. In the  proceedings before the Commission, the NPCL made Additional  Submissions on 16 Nov. 2006 seeking certain reliefs.     ICS  3. The Commission despite having found the transaction being  costliest proceeded to consider it as a ‘sunk cost’ as it was fait  accompli, and directed vide impugned order that NPCL should  compensate the cost incurred by the UPPCL by making payment  to it at the rate of marginal cost as claimed by the UPPCL.  However, in order to balance the higher cost for 10 MW to be  borne by the NPCL it further directed that for the original 45 MW  No. of corrections           Page 4 of 23  Appeal no. 26/07 & appeal No. 36/07  of power bulk supply tariff fixed earlier should be reduced and  the NPCL should pay for the bulk supply of 45 MW at the rate of  1.987 per unit. While UPPCL is aggrieved of the order reducing  the bulk supply tariff rate for the 45 MW power the NPCL is  aggrieved with the order directing it to pay for the 10 MW of  additional power at marginal cost for being ‘sunk cost’. Both the  members are of the opinion that the Commission could not have  altered the bulk supply tariff for the original 45 MW of power  which had been fixed by an earlier tariff order. However, they  are at divergence about the price to be paid for the additional 10  MW.     4. One of us, the Judicial Member, has found that the appeal of  UPPCL has to be allowed and that of NPCL dismissed. The  rationale for such finding is as under.   5. NPCL challenged the impugned order on the following  grounds:    i) The agreement dated 08.05.2006 was  obtained by UPPCL from NPCL by undue  influence as defined under Section 16 of the  Contract Act and did not amount to a contract  under Section 10.      ii) The claim of UPPCL to charge power supply  to one distribution company in the State @  Rs.8.80 per unit while it is supplying to all other  distribution companies in the State at the rate  of Rs.1.897 per unit is clearly discriminatory  and un-constitutional.        ICS  No. of corrections           Page 5 of 23  Appeal no. 26/07 & appeal No. 36/07   iii) The agreement dated 08.05.2006 was  contrary to law and therefore not binding and  enforceable under Section 23 of The Contract  Act.      iv) UPPLC being a State transmission utility is  not permitted to trade in electricity.      v) There is no clear concept of marginal cost.  Therefore so called agreement dated 08.05.06  could not amount to a valid contract”     6. The Judicial Member finds that order dated 08 May 2006  was a valid contract and not hit by either Section 16 or by  Section 23 of the Contract Act. She also finds that the marginal  cost contract was not discriminatory. So far as UPPCL’s function  as a trader is concerned, the Judicial Member finds it to be  irrelevant to the controversy. She finds the concept of marginal  cost generally understood and clear and particularly defined by  the letter of dated 10 May 2006 of the UPPCL and that the  parties fully understood what they were agreeing to and hence  the contract was not bad for uncertainty. The Judicial Member  also holds that dominant position heretofore enjoyed by UPPCL  being the transmission utility and by denying open access had  come to an end in January 2006 when open access was made  available to NPCL as evidenced by letter of 13 Jan. 2006 of the  UPPCL. She finds that NPCL, despite availability of open access  as well as offers from other suppliers for additional electricity,  opted to enter into the agreement with UPPCL for supply of 10  MW at marginal cost. The Judicial Member also holds that NPCL  ICS  No. of corrections           Page 6 of 23  Appeal no. 26/07 & appeal No. 36/07  was not a company which could be entitled to succeed to any of  the power purchase agreements held by the erstwhile UP State  Electricity Board. The Judicial Member further holds that the  transaction in question is not hit by Section 60 of the Electricity  Act 2003.",

Chahal,  Advocates       JUDGMENT     Per Hon’ble A.A. Khan, Technical Member     I have perused the judgement of the learned Judicial Member Hon’ble  Mrs. Justice Manju Goel but have failed to persuade myself in aligning my  views on certain aspects with that of her’s and respectfully disagree with her  judgment in draft, whereby she has dismissed the Appeal No. 36 filed by  Noida Power Corporation Ltd. and allowed the Appeal No. 26 filed by  U.P.P.C.L.  Hence, I am writing my own independent judgment on these  appeals.     2 of 45  Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007    Introduction  2. The case relates to two cross appeals No. 26 & 36 of 2007,  against  the impugned order dated 08 Feb. 2007 of UP Electricity Regulatory  Commission (hereinafter refer to as ‘Commission’), passed   in Petition No.  414 of 2006 involving Noida Power Corporation Ltd. (for brevity to be  called as ‘NPCL’), a joint venture company of Greater Noida Authority and  CESCON Ltd. for supplying electricity in Greater Noida area and U.P.  Power Corporation Ltd. (for brevity referred to as ‘UPPCL’) a company  wholly owned by the State Government of U.P., currently charged with the  responsibility of bulk purchase and supply of Power within the territory of  U.P.  During the relevant period of the instant case, UPPCL was additionally  charged with the functions of State Transmission Utility (STU). The  impugned order was passed, under Section 86 of the Electricity Act 2003  (for short ‘the Act’) read with Section 34 of the Uttar Pradesh Electricity  Reforms Act, 1999, in the aforesaid petition filed by the Appellant NPCL  before the Commission.  As both appeals traverse the common issues I, for  convenience, have chosen Appeal No. 36 of 2007 as lead appeal.  The  Appellant is aggrieved  by that part of the impugned order vide which the  Commission has allowed Respondent, UPPCL, to charge the Appellant at  the marginal cost for supply of additional 10 MW of power to NPCL,  3 of 45  Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007    despite holding in the impugned order itself that on account of non- allocation of the PPAs, the condition of retail supply tariff at uniform rate  across the State and the denial of open access to the appellant, the imposition  of burden of extremely high marginal cost on the Appellant will be  unreasonable, discriminatory and unfair to it.  The appellant, UPPCL has  challenged the other part of the impugned order whereby the Commission  has reduced the tariff of 45 MW supply, during the period of dispute, which  NPCL has been availing since beginning, to the average of the pool cost of  power applied to other distribution companies of the State.     Brief Background    3. On 11 December 1992 Greater Noida Authority entered into a  Memorandum of Understanding with CESCON Ltd. to set up a joint venture  company for the purpose of supplying electricity to the consumers in the  Greater Noida area.  To give effect to the provisions of the said agreement,  Noida Power Company Ltd (NPCL), who is the Appellant in the present  appeal before us, was floated jointly with 27% ownership held by Greater  Noida Authority.    4. The Appellant entered into an Agreement on 15 November 1993 with  4 of 45  Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007    UPSEB (predecessor of the Respondent) for taking over distribution of  power in the Greater Noida notified area.  The agreement provided for  UPSEB to supply 45 MVA of electricity to the appellant.  The said  agreement also envisaged that the Appellant has to supply electricity to its  consumers at the rate which shall not be more than the tariff fixed by the  UPSEB.  This arrangement of having uniform tariff throughout the state of  UP is still continuing.  The agreement was initially for a period of four and a  half years which was subsequently extended from time to time.  As regards  tariff for supply of electricity by UPSEB to NPCL, the agreement provided  for a tentative rate of Rs. 1.66 per unit, which was required to be studied and  revised by an independent authority to be nominated by the Government of  UP.    5. The Appellant was granted a license by the State Government of UP  on 30 August 2003 under the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910.   Consequent upon the enactment of the Electricity Act, 2003 (the Act), the  Appellant became a deemed distribution licensee in accordance with the  First Proviso of Section 14 of the Act.    6. In pursuance to the agreement between the parties, the State  Government, one after another, appointed two committees, to examine the  5 of 45  Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007    rate of charge of electricity to be supplied by UPSEB to NPCL.  However,  the Appellant and Respondent did not reach consensus in accepting any  single tariff recommended by the said committees.  In the meanwhile, the  Uttar Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission was constituted and  established in accordance with the provisions of the Electricity Regulatory  Commissions Act, 1998 (for short ‘ERC Act 1998’).    7. The Lucknow Bench of the Allahabad High Court on being  approached by the Appellant, directed the ‘Commission’ to fix the power  purchase price.  The Commission determined the tariff for supply of  electricity by UPPCL to NPCL at Rs. 1.39 per unit for 1993-2000 and at Rs.  2.56 per unit for year 1999-2000.  The High Court through its order dated 10  November 2005 approved the above rates.    8. The Appellant has submitted that on the face of the growing demand  from the consumers it requested the Respondent to either provide open  access so that the Appellant could import power from third party or in the  alternative the Respondent may supply additional power to meet the  demand.  First such letter was written in September 2003.  Subsequently, the  Appellant approached the Commission in 2004 to direct UPPCL to allow  open access.  The Commission directed the Respondent to take necessary  6 of 45  Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007    action in the matter of providing open access to the appellant.  The  Respondent expressed its inability before the Commission to provide open  access due to transmission constraints.  It is pertinent to mention here that  the Respondent during the relevant period has been performing the dual  responsibility of State Transmission Utility and purchase/sale of bulk power  which is repugnant to the Act.  Thus, as per the provision of Section 39 of  the Act providing of non-discriminatory open access to inter-State  transmission system to any licensee or generating company, is the  responsibility of the Respondent.     9. It has been submitted by the Appellant that the ‘Commission’ vide its  order dated 08 Dec. 2005 directed the Respondent not to take any coercive  action against the Appellant unless it (UPERC) specifies otherwise expressly  by an order because such disruption in supply to the NPCL would cause  unimaginable hardships to all sections of the consumers of the area.  The  order further directed the parties to submit a copy of the Power Purchase  Agreement (PPA) signed for bulk supply of power.  The Appellant states  that a draft PPA was submitted to UPPCL but the same was not signed.   Consequently, no PPA had been submitted to the Commission.  When  queried the Respondent, UPPCL answered that it has been making purchases  7 of 45  Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007    of over 400 MWs of power over and above through the long-term PPA,  central allocation, etc. to meet the shortfalls in the demand from the  distribution companies.      10. There were dialogues between the Appellant and the Respondent for  supply of additional power to NPCL.  Here I may refer to a letter dated 13  January 2006 written by the Respondent which stated that “you are aware  that in the last meeting we have agreed to allocate additional power to  NPCL to meet the growing demand.  This additional allocation would  be available after 400 kv sub-station of Greater Noida, being  constructed by BHEL, is commissioned which is expected to be  completed by March, 2006.”",

Decision to be by majority. – If the Members of the Appellant  Tribunal of a Bench consisting of two Members differ in opinion on  any point, they shall state the point or points on which they differ,   and make a reference to the Chairperson of the Appellate Tribunal  who shall either hear the point or points himself or refer the case for  hearing on such point or points by one or more of the other Members  of the Appellate Tribunal an such point or points shall be decided  according to the opinion of the majority of the Members of the  Appellate Tribunal who have heard the case, including those who first  heard it.”     3. One of us (Hon’ble Technical Member Mr. H.L. Bajaj) by his  judgment delivered on 08.05.2008 has decided the core issue of dispute in  the original Appeals being the ‘Marginal Cost’ defining it to be as  “incremental cost to procure next unit of electricity” which is an  internationally accepted definition and concluding that “I hold that the  ‘Marginal Cost’ is the average pooled purchase cost of the additional power  which has to be applied to the entire 400 MW additional procurement.   Remaining issues of divergence get covered with this finding by me.”  This  3 of 12  Concluding 26 & 36/07  definition of ‘Marginal Cost’ and its implementation in the instant case are  in congruence with the judgment of one of us (Hon’ble Technical Member  Mr. A.A. Khan) except that cost of power procured through the mechanism  of unscheduled inter-change will also be taken into account while working  out the average pooled purchase cost of additional power of 400 MW.    4. Reliance on the Minutes of Meeting of the group of Forum of Indian  Regulators for giving recommendations on the computation of Surcharge  and Additional Surcharge on  account of Open Access held on December  17-18, 2004 cannot be placed for the definition of Marginal Cost as the same   is given merely as an assumption for considering the alternative method of  computing quantum of Surcharge and  subsequently, the Tariff Policy,      inter alia, dealing with cross subsidy Surcharge and Additional Surcharge  for Open Access  has been issued by the Government of India on January 06,  2006.  5. In view of the above the decision on the substantive issue of ,Marginal  Cost’ being in line with the judgment of one of us (Hon’ble Technical  Member Mr. A.A. Khan) we adopt the same as majority judgment.     6. In the result, Appeal No. 26 of 2007 fails and is dismissed and Appeal  No. 36 of 2007 is allowed, with no orders as to costs.    Pronounced in the open court on this 12th day of May, 2008.      (H.L. Bajaj)                  (A.A. Khan)    Technical Member         Technical Member         4 of 12  Concluding 26 & 36/07  As per Ms. Justice Manju Goel, Judicial Member    The majority view of this Tribunal that has emerged after  reference under section 123 of the Electricity Act 2003 is that  the marginal cost has to be computed at average rate of the  rates of the incremental purchase of UPPCL aggregating to  over 400 MW as put by the learned Technical Member Shri  A.A.Khan in his own judgment or the average pooled purchase  cost of additional power which has to be applied to the entire  400 MW additional procurement as said by learned Technical  Member, Shri.H.L.Bajaj.  At the outset I need to remind myself  that the issue before this Tribunal did not relate to tariff  fixation as done under section 62 and the relevant rules and  regulations in this behalf.  Hon’ble Shri H.L.Bajaj has referred  to Appeal No. 124 of 2005 in the case of Kashi Vishwanath Vs  UERC dated 02nd June, 2006 in which the Tribunal has ruled  that the tariff has to be determined on the “basis of pooled  average cost of power purchase from all sources for all  categories of consumers”. This rule has no application to the  present case in which we are confronted with the question of  interpretation of a contract and the question as to whether the  seller of power is entitled to recover his dues.  It is the  question of contract inter se two parties and not the question  of tariff generally.      2) The question before us is not what is marginal cost.  The  5 of 12  Concluding 26 & 36/07  question is what was understood to be the marginal cost.  The  question is not what the contract should have been.  The  question is what the contract has been.  The question is  whether a court can refuse to enforce a contract having held  that the contract is valid and enforceable.  The question is  whether one party having got a contract specifically enforced  decline to perform his part of the contract.  The question is  whether the party having received a benefit under the contract  can resist a claim for the consideration on the ground that the  consideration has worked out to be more than his expectation.       3) The whole question depends upon the interpretation of  contract entered into by the two parties – the UP Power  Corporation Ltd. (UPPCL) and NOIDA Power Co. Ltd. (NPCL).   The majority view is also that the contract between the parties  is a legal and valid contract.  The contract is not vitiated for  any reason.  The seller should be entitled to recover the  contractual price of commodity sold.  Therefore, there is no  escape from the conclusion that UPPCL, supplier of power is  entitled to recover the contracted price from NPCL.      4) The next question, therefore, is what is the contracted  price?  In my earlier judgment I have gone into the sequence of  events which I do not think is necessary to reproduce here  again.  My judgment dated 25.10.07 may be read as a part of  the present order.  6 of 12  Concluding 26 & 36/07    5) The letter of 08.05.06 is closely followed by the letter of  10.05.06.  The letter of 10.05.06 refers to the decision to  supply 10 MW of additional electricity to NPCL.  Therefore, this  letter obviously refers to the contract which is evidenced by  the letter of 08.05.06.  There is no point in saying that the  letter dated 10.05.06 does not refer to the letter dated  08.05.06 as the letter dated 10.05.06 was occasioned on  account of additional supply of power as agreed to by the letter  dated 08.05.06.  The definition of marginal cost as given in  letter of 10.05.06 is virtually the same as the definition of  marginal cost given by the Forum of Indian Regulators in the  Minutes of Meeting held on 17th & 18th December, 2004.",

The Tata Power Company Limited (TPC or Tata Power in  short) has filed the present appeal challenging  the  following two orders passed by Maharashtra Electricity  Regulatory Commission (MERC or the Commission in  short):-    (a) Order dated October 03, 2006 passed in Case Nos.  12/2005 & 56/2005 re: ARR & Tariff Petitions filed for  FY 2005-06 & FY 2006-07 (Impugned Tariff Order); and    (b) Order dated March 22, 2007 passed in Case No.  47/2006  re: Review Petition against the Order dated  October 03, 2006 passed in Case Nos. 12/2005 & 56/2005  (Impugned Review Order).    2. The present appeal essentially challenges the denial of  expenses in respect of nine items given below along with  financial impact of each:  GB  No. of corrections    Page 3 of 35       Appeal no. 60 of 2007    Net Impact (Rs.

TPC has submitted that out of nine heads of claim, some  are covered by the judgment of this Tribunal and Hon’ble  Supreme Court which are applicable in their case also.      4. We now proceed to deal with each issue one by one.      GB  No. of corrections    Page 4 of 35       Appeal no. 60 of 2007     ISSUE NO. 1: DISALLOWANCE OF DEPRECIATION:    5. TPC is aggrieved by the partial disallowance of depreciation  claims in the Financial Years  2004-05 and 2005-06 by MERC  who has observed as under:-  “Tata Power submitted the actual depreciation  expenditure in FY 2004-05 and FY 2005-06, which have  been computed partly in accordance with the  depreciation rates considered in the Tariff Order.  However, in case of plant and machinery under  Transmission assets, the actual depreciation costs (Rs  68.54 Crore) for FY 2004-05 as submitted by TPC under  Form F3 over Opening Gross fixed Assets (Rs 468.03  Crore) is very high and the depreciation rate works out  to 14.65% during FY 2004-05. TPC is directed to submit  the Auditor’s certificate certifying that the accumulated  depreciation for each asset in the asset register has not  exceeded 90% of the asset value, as depreciation  cannot be claimed beyond 90% of the asset value.  ………”    6. TPC filed a petition seeking review of the above finding while  placing on record the Auditor’s certificate confirming the fact that  TPC has limited its depreciation claim to 90% of the original cost  of the assets.  Further, TPC made certain submissions on fact  and law which have not found favour with MERC which  dismissed this claim by holding that:-   GB  No. of corrections    Page 5 of 35       Appeal no. 60 of 2007  (a) The useful life of the transmission assets as  stipulated in the Ministry of Power Notification of March  1994 on ‘Depreciation Norms for Licensees’ would be  applicable. The fair life of transmission assets as  stipulated in the aforesaid Notification ranges between  25 to 35 years depending upon the voltage. Hence the  balance useful life of the asset would be at least 20  years as against the submission of TPC which  contended that the remaining useful life of the asset is  nil.   (b) Since the Auditors Certificate indicates that the  FERV has been capitalized and depreciated to the  extent of 100%. Though the principle assets has been  depreciated only 90%, the depreciation on the  capitalized FERV should also be limited to 90% and as  a result of which the extent of depreciation additional  allowable would reduce by 3.72 Crores.   (c) As regards the capitalization of the insurance  spares and corresponding depreciation, the impact in  FY 2004-05 was because of change in accounting policy  of the Company, which does not clarify in either  mistake or error apparent on the face of record or  discover of new and important matters or evidence and  as such review of depreciation extendable on account of  capitalization of insurance spares was rejected.      GB  No. of corrections    Page 6 of 35       Appeal no. 60 of 2007  7. In its written submission MERC has further explained and  substantiated the rejection primarily  on the following grounds:     (a) Since TPC had not given the details of assets affected  of FERV and the age and balance useful life of the asset, the  Commission was not in a position to compute the quantum  of FERV in the amount of depreciation allowable in the  current years ARR.  (b) Auditors Certificate submitted by TPC indicates that  FERV has been capitalized and depreciated to the extent of  100% though the principal asset has been depreciated only  90% in accordance with the regulatory requirements. Hence  the depreciation of capitalized FERV also instead limited to  90% as a result of which the extent of depreciation  additional allowable would reduce by 3.72 Crores.   (c) For the assets for which repayment is in progress, it  will not be proper to consider that the asset has completed  its useful life.  (d) As regards the insurance spares, the details in that  regard had not been brought to the notice of the  Commission and were brought only at the time of Review  Petition. Since furnishing of new details would not clarify  for review under MERC regulations, the same could not be  considered. The relevant Accounting Standards-11 (AS-11)  was made applicable from accounting years 2004-05.  GB  No. of corrections    Page 7 of 35       Appeal no. 60 of 2007  According to AS-11 (Revised 2003), forex evaluation on  account of repayment of loan solely incurred for the  purposes of clearing the asset should no longer be  capitalized and be charged to the revenue.     8. TPC submitted that it had provided for and claimed  depreciation for the period in question on the basis of the  opening asset block of Rs.468.04 Crores based on the a detailed  fixed asset register maintained by them, applying a weighted  average depreciation rate of 6.73% derived from the applicable  rates as notified by the Ministry of Power on March 26, 1994  pursuant to the VI Schedule to the Supply Act. TPC contends  that “Plant and Machinery” covers assets which attract  deprecation rates ranging from 1.8% to 45% in terms of the  Schedule to the 1994 notification which resulted in the weighted  average depreciation rate of 6.73%. However, MERC has applied  a depreciation rate of 5% for the said block of asset.     9. TPC extensively relied upon the principles, purpose and  application of useful life and rate of depreciation as provided for  under the Ministry of Power’s Notifications of 1992 and 1994 as  GB  No. of corrections    Page 8 of 35       Appeal no. 60 of 2007  laid down in the judgments of this Tribunal dated May 24, 2006  and September 29, 2006 passed in Appeal No. 122 of 2005, and  as upheld by the Hon’ble Supreme Court in Delhi Electricity  Regulatory Commission vs BSES Yamuna Power Ltd & Others  [(2007) 3 SCC 33].    10. Per contra learned senior counsel appearing for MERC has  contended that the reliance on the judgment of the Hon’ble  Supreme Court was limited to the peculiar facts of the five year ",

A. Khan, Technical Member    Under Section 111 (2) of Electricity Act, 2003      In the matter of :    M/s Eurotex Industries And Exports Limited  Plot E-1 and E-23, MIDC, Gokul Shirgaon  Kolhapur - 416234  ….Appellant     Versus       1. Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Company Limited    Prakash Garh, Bandra (E)   Mumbai – 400051     2. Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission   World Trade Centre, Centre No. 1, 13th Floor,   Cuffe Parade, Mumbai – 400005    … Respondents       Counsel for the Appellant  :  Mr. Haresh M. Jagtiani, Sr. Advocate and   Ms. Divya Bahi, Advs.   Mr. R.K. Aggarwal (Rep.)       Counsel for the Respondent  :  Mr. Buddy A. Ranganadhan  Mr. Arjit MAitra for MERC and          Mr. Ravi Prakash, Mr. Vikas Singh,   Ms. Neelam Singh, Mr. Vikrant Ghumare and   Mr. Jitendra Singh, Advs.  for MSEDCL      1 of 17  Appeal No. 135 of 07      Judgment    Per Hon’ble  Mr. A.A. Khan, Technical Member    This Appeal challenges the order of the Maharashtra State Electricity Regulator  Commission (hereinafter referred to as ‘the Commission/MERC’) passed on 19  Sep 07 (impugned order) under Regulation 85 of MERC (Conduct of Business)  Regulations 2004 (to be called as “CBR”) read with Section 61 and 62 of the  Electricity Act 2003.    Facts of the Case and Discussion   2. The Appellant M/s Eurotex Industries and Exports Limited (to be referred  to as “M/s Eurotex”) is a HT-continuous process industry in the private sector,  engaged primarily in the manufacturing and export of cotton yarn and knitted  fabrics.  It is a government recognized export house having 100% export oriented  units.  M/s Eurotex is a HT consumer of Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution  Company Ltd. (for brevity to be referred to as “MSEDCL”), which is Respondent  No. 1 in the instant appeal.     3. The Appellant filed a Review Petition before the Commission on 22 June  07 under Regulation 85 of CBR seeking review of Commission’s order dated 18  May 07 passed in case No. 65 of 2006 in the Multi Year Tariff Petition filed by  MSEDCL for the control period from FY 2007-08 to 2009-2010 and tariff for  2 of 17  Appeal No. 135 of 07  Financial Year 2007-08.  The aforesaid review petition of the Appellant sought to  alter/modify the original clause 7.4(g) of the MERC High Tension tariff order  dated 18 May 07 which came into effect from 01 May 07.  The Review petition  was disposed of by the Commission through its impugned order dated 19 Sep. 07    4. The contract demand of the Appellant till March, 2006 was 3000 KVA  which was enhanced to the 4900 KVA with effect from 01 Apr. 06 after the  approval by MSEDCL vide its letter dated 04 Feb 06.  The Appellant during April  06 to June 06 conducted trial runs of the various production machines for quality  stabilizations and for establishing the standards of its processing activity  associated with the utilization of the increased contract demand.  Even though the  maximum record demand during the aforesaid period was nearly 88% to 95% of  4900 KVA, the actual consumption of the energy was in the vicinity of 61% to  71% of the maximum demand energy.  Since July 06,  however, the actual energy  consumption has proportionately increased in step with the increasing build-up of  contract demand up to 4900 KVA.    5. Clause 7.4(g) of the original order dated 18 May 07 specifying the fixing of  benchmark units to calculate the Additional Supply Charge (ASC) of consumers is  reproduced below     3 of 17  Appeal No. 135 of 07  “In case of consumers whose sanctioned load/contract demand had been  duly increased after the billing month of December, 2005, the reference  period may be taken as billing period after six months of the increase in the  sanctioned load/contract demand or the billing period of the month in  which the consumer has utilized at least 75% of the sanctioned  load/contract demand, whichever is earlier.”      The application filed by MSEDCL seeking the approval of the Annual  Revenue Requirement (ARR) from the Commission did not include the proposal  as contained in Clause 7.4(g).  The Appellant has stated that it realized the impact  of Clause 7.4(g) only after the order was issued. The scenario that emerged was  that while Clause 7.4(g) lays down the criterion for calculation of ASC units based  on energy consumption, the reference period is based on reaching 75% of the  contract demand.    6. In order to decide the reference benchmark for the consumption level the  above stated clause specify the following criteria:     (a) billing period after six months of the increase in the sanctioned  load/contract demand.  (b) billing period of the month in which the consumer has utilized at  least 75% of the increased sanctioned load/contract demand   4 of 17  Appeal No. 135 of 07  (C) whichever of the above criteria is achieved earlier shall be the  reference period for calculation of bench mark units for determining ASC.     7. The Appellant states that after installation of the machinery against  increased contract demand the trial runs on them had commenced with effect from  01 Apr. 06 and the additional demand of 75% of the increased contract demand  may have been achieved within a few hours of the start up.  The Appellant states  that the entire process of establishing the production process involves several trial  runs and re-runs of short durations, inspections of the new system machineries for  adherence to quality standards, technical adjustment for quality products etc. and  will involve a period of up to 6 months for normalizing the production process so  as to reach optimum level of energy consumption.  The Appellant avers that while  the monthly maximum demand may have exceeded the specific threshold of 75%  or more of the contract demand in short duration of the initial period of trial runs,  the energy consumption, because of re-runs and intermittent nature of operation,  gets restricted to a level below the consumption as a percentage of maximum  energy that will be recorded during the post stabilization period.  In this context,  the Appellant has indicated that whereas the maximum demand as a percentage of  contract demand was reached to the level of 88 to 95% in the first month itself, the  actual energy units consumption as a percentage of the maximum energy was very  low at 61% to 74%.  The less energy consumption is stated to be because of the  intermittent operation of the just installed production machinery and equipment  5 of 17  Appeal No. 135 of 07  during stabilization period.  The following table as furnished by the Appellant,  depicts the maximum demand and energy consumption for the billing period of  April 2006 to October, 2006.    S.  No.   Billing Month  and year   Energy  consumed  (Units)   Maximum  Demand (kVA) Percent  Consumption of  maximum energy   1 April 2006 2161200 4584 61%  2 May 2006 2526900 4332 72%  3 June 2006 2705760 4752 74%  4 July 2006 3190140 4752 91%  5 August 2006 3298800 4752 94%  6 September  2006  2142760 4860 87%  7 October 2006 3173760 4842 90%    8. The Appellant states that it was only in July 2006 that it was in a position to  utilize its full production capacity and the maximum demand as a percentage of  the contract demand was reached to 96.97% and energy consumption as a  percentage of maximum energy went up to 91%.  The Appellant confirms that  since Jul 2006, it has been maintaining the level of utilization of its increased  capacity and maximum demand and energy consumption have attained optimum  level in a steady state manner.     9. The Commission in its clarificatory order dated 24 Aug. 07 against the  MSEDCL’s clarificatory Petition in Case No. 26 of 2007 has clarified as under:       6 of 17  Appeal No. 135 of 07  “Commission’s Clarification and Ruling   In case of consumers whose sanctioned load/Contract Demand had  been duly increased after the billing month of December, 2005, the  reference period may be taken as the billing period after six months  of the increase in the sanctioned load/Contract Demand or the  billing period of the month in which the third occasion of the  consumer utilizing at least 75% of the increased sanctioned load /  Contract Demand after increasing the Contract demand is  recorded, whichever is earlier. (Emphasis supplied)      10. The Commission thereafter in a second clarificatory order in Case Nos. 26  of 2007 and 65 of 2006 passed on 11 Sep. 07 in respect of reference billing period  for HT foundries in cases of increased contract demand has stated as under:     “In case of consumers whose sanctioned load/Contract Demand had  been duly increased after the billing month of December, 2005, the  reference period may be taken as the billing period after six months  of the increase in the sanctioned load/Contract Demand or the  billing period of the month in which the third occasion of the  consumer utilizing at least 75% of the increased sanctioned  load/contract demand after increasing the Contract Demand is  recorded, which ever is earlier.",

Bajaj, Technical Member         Appellant has challenged the order dated February 06,  2007 of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (CERC  or the Commission in short) in Petition No.119/2005, under  which the tariff for the period January 14, 2004 to March 31,  2004 and April 01, 2004 to March 31, 2009 of Indira Sagar  Hydro Electric Project (ISP in short) of Narmada Hydro  Development Corporation, (NHDC in short) was determined.    ICS  No. of corrections    Page 2 of 25  Appeal No. 42 of 2007  2. CERC vide the impugned order had determined the tariff  of the Indra Sagar HEP in accordance with the provisions of  the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission (Terms and  Conditions of Tariff) Regulations, 2004 ( hereinafter referred to  as the Tariff Regulations, 2004).  Aggrieved by the said order,  the appellant has raised the following issues in the appeal.    ISSUE 1: Date of commercial operation of various       units of ISP       ISSUE 2:  Debt-Equity-Ratio      ISSUE 3:  Advance against depreciation     ISSUE  4: Infirm Power.      3. We now proceed to discuss and decide each of the above  three issues.      ISSUE 1:  DATE OF COMMERCIAL OPERATION  OF VARIOUS UNITS OF ISP.     4. NHDC has claimed the following Dates for Commercial  Operation(COD in short) of various units which have been  approved by CERC and accordingly tariff was determined.  ICS  No. of corrections    Page 3 of 25  Appeal No. 42 of 2007    Machine  No.  Actual COD From   14.01.04 to  31.03.04 (MW)  From  27.07.04 to  31.03.05 (MW)  From  26.08.05  onwards  (MW)  Machine 1 14.01.2004 82.81 106.82 125  Machine 2 18.01.2004 82.81 106.82 125  Machine 3 06.03.2004 82.81 106.82 125  Machine 4 29.03.2004 82.81 106.82 125  Machine 5 27.07.2004  106.82 125  Machine 6 07.01.2005  106.82 125  Machine 7 01.11.2004  106.82 125  Machine 8 30.03.2005  106.82 125    5. Appellant has contended that as per definition of COD in  Regulations, 2001, the same will be within 15 days from the  date of synchronization of a unit with the grid.  Since units 1  to 4 were synchronized during the period 2001-2004, hence  the appellant is not challenging the date of COD of these  units.    6. Here it is relevant to set out the definition of COD.  As  per Regulation, 2004, the COD of a unit has been defined in  Regulation 31(ix) as below:  “31(ix) ‘Date of Commercial Operation’ or ‘COD’ in  relation to a unit means the date declared by the  generator after demonstrating the Maximum  Continuous Rating (MCR) or Installed Capacity (IC)  through a successful trial run, after notice to the  beneficiaries, and in relation to the generating station  the date of commercial operation means the date of  ICS  No. of corrections    Page 4 of 25  Appeal No. 42 of 2007  commercial operation of the last unit of the  generating station.”    7. Learned counsel for the appellant  contended that thus,  the date on which the Maximum Continuous Rating (MCR) or  Installed Capacity(IC) of a unit has been shown by the  Generator, the said date will be date of COD of that unit and  the COD of the last unit of the generating station would be the  date of COD of the generating station.    8. He submitted that the Commission in the Impugned  Order has held that date of COD of the generating station for  the purpose of tariff determination would be August 25, 2005  which itself shows that the last unit of the I.S.P. has achieved  the MCR or installed capacity on August 25, 2005.  Otherwise  also from the Tariff Petition  itself all the eight machines have  achieved the MCR or Installed Capacity only on August 25,  2005.  Thus, the date of COD of machine No. 5 to 8 will be  August 25, 2005 and not the dates on which these units  started generation as per the definition of COD given in the  Regulations.  ICS  No. of corrections    Page 5 of 25  Appeal No. 42 of 2007    9. Learned counsel for the appellant asserted that the  energy sold by NHDC from Machine/Unit No. 5 to 8 between  July 27, 2004 to August 24, 2005 would be infirm power and  the payment received has to be deducted from the capital cost  of the I.S.P.    10. Per contra CERC and NHDC have submitted that the  issues raised by the appellant are misconceived and gave  detailed explanations as under:      11. The appellant has alleged that the Central Commission  instead of determining the date of commercial operation of the  project as March 31, 2005 as per the provisions of regulation  31 (ix) of Tariff Regulations, 2004 (supra) has  adopted August  25, 2005 as date of commercial operation when the maximum  continuous rating of the generating station was achieved.  As a  result, the Central Commission has allowed more IDC to  NHDC.    ICS  No. of corrections    Page 6 of 25  Appeal No. 42 of 2007  12. CERC decision to allow August 25, 2005 as the date of  commercial operation of the project in place of March 31, 2005  needs to be considered in the context of the peculiar situation  associated with the execution of the generating station.  Indira  Sagar Hydro Electric Project, executed by Narmada Hydro  Electric Development Corporation Limited, the second  respondent herein, is a multi purpose project to facilitate  power generation and create facilities for irrigation.  The  project has three major parts.  Part I comprises of dam and  appurtenant works,  Part II comprises of irrigation system,  and Part III comprises of power station,  associated water  conductor system and switchyard.  The power station has  installed capacity of 1000 MW and has eight machines of 125  MW each.  CERC submitted that as a matter of convention in  case of Hydro generating stations, the dam is completed first  and the generating units are  commissioned thereafter.   However, in case of Indira Sagar HE Project, while the dam  was still under construction, the eight units of the generating  stations were commissioned between January 14, 2004 to  ICS  No. of corrections    Page 7 of 25  Appeal No. 42 of 2007  March 30, 2005 on various dated as mentioned against each  in the table given below:  Machine         Date of commercial operation  Machine I 14.1.2004  Machine II 18.1.2004  Machine III 6.3.2004  Machine IV 29.3.2004  Machine V 27.7.2004  Machine VI 1.11.2004  Machine VII 7.1.2005  Machine VIII 30.3.2005    13. Although all the units of the generating station were  commissioned by March 30, 2005 as per the details given  above; however, due to non-completion of dam up to its Full  Reservoir Level (FRL) and being the lean inflow period,  sufficient water was not available for the plant to declare the  Maximum Continuous Rating (MCR), which, in the present  case, means the maximum output the station can generate at  rated head and rated discharge required for 8 generating  units.   The station at that stage (as on March 30, 2005) was  able to generate maximum output of 854 MW against the  required maximum output of 1000 MW for commercial  commissioning of all the 8 units.",

Present:  Hon’ble Mr. Justice Anil Dev Singh, Chairperson  Hon’ble Mr. A. A. Khan, Technical Member      IN THE MATTER OF:      Reliance Energy Limited,      …Appellant                                  Versus    Maharashtra Electricity Regulatory Commission & Anr.….Respondents      Counsel for the Appellant(s) : Mr. J.J. Bhat, Sr. Advocate,   Ms. Anjali Chandurkar &    Mr. Syed Naqvi.       Ms. Smieetaa Inna.  Counsel for the Respondent(s): Mr. Darius Khambatta, Sr. Advocate        Mr. Shrikant Doijode,  Mr. Parag Kabadi,  Ms. Ruby Sigh Ahuja ,  Ms. Pragya Baghel &  Mr. Abeer Kumar for Resp. No. 2        Mr. Buddy A. Ranganadhan   for Resp. No. 1    JUDGMENT     Per Hon’ble A.A. Khan, Technical Member       1. The Appellant, Reliance Energy Limited (hereinafter referred to as ‘REL’ or  ‘BSEB’ as known earlier) has challenged the order of Respondent No. 1, Maharashtra  Electricity Regulatory Commission (for brevity referred to as ‘MERC’/’The  Commission’) passed on 12 Dec. 2007 in Case No. 7 of 2002 relating to petition filed by   Page 1 of 22  Appeal No 3 of 2008    Respondent No. 2, Tata Power Company Ltd. (for short ‘TPC’) whereby certain alleged  outstanding dues on account of differences in energy rates between R. 2.09 per kwh ad  Rs. 1.77 per kwh  and shortfall in minimum off-take of energy claimed by ‘TPC’ from  ‘REL’ (Reliance Energy Ltd. Which was earlier known as BSES) are allowed by the  impugned order.    FACTS OF THE CASE  2. TPC has been a licensee to generate and supply electricity in Mumbai area for  over eight decades and, inter alia, directly supplies power to railways, refineries, ports,  commercial and domestic consumers and is the bulk supplier of power to distribution  licensees namely BEST (Brihan Mumbai Electricity Supply and Transport Undertaking),  a Public Limited Company and REL a private company in Mumbai region.  Till 1995  when REL established a 500 MW power plant at Dahanu, Maharashtra, REL had no  generating station of its own and used to purchase its entire requirement of electricity in  bulk from TPC and distribute the same to the consumers in its licensed area of Mumbai.   The bulk supply from TPC to REL was being made through a number of 33 KV/22 KV  ports.  The issues raised in this appeal arise from the Principles of Agreement (POA)  reached on 31 Jan. 98 between TPC and REL leading to commencement of standby  facility from TPC to REL through interconnection arrangement between their network  systems and this Tribunal had an opportunity of examining the facts in detail while  deciding an appeal in this regard earlier.  In order to better appreciate and interpret the  clauses of POA, it is essential to recapitulate events which had occurred prior to signing  of POA.       3. The Appellant holds a distribution license since 1926 for supply of electricity to  the consumers located in the suburbs of Mumbai. In 1976, the said license was amended  to permit it to install a 500 MW power plant at Dahanu, Maharashtra. The said license  was further amended in 1992 imposing certain conditions which, inter-alia, reads thus:  “7(B)(1) The Licensee has complied with Sub-clauses(1) and  (2) above and the government of Maharashtra has extended  further the Company’s License till 15 th  August, 2011 as  mentioned in Clause 13 herein below”    Page 2 of 22  Appeal No 3 of 2008      (2) On the commencement of generation from the said  generating stations referred to in Clause 7A, the Licensee shall  supply the power so generated to their consumers by making  their own transmission and distribution arrangements.     (3) The Licensee shall also execute suitable interconnection  with the system of Tata Electric Companies with the approval  of the Central Electricity Authority, New Delhi.    (4) If the government of Maharasthra is of the opinion that the  Licensee has not duly carried Companies with the approval of  the Central Electricity out its obligations specified in Sub- clauses(2) and (3) hereof or the Licensee has not complied with  any of the terms and conditions of this License, this License  shall be liable to be revoked.     13A. The Licensee agrees that in the event of dispute regarding  whether the Licensee has carried out its obligations mentioned in  Sub-clause (4) of Clause 7 B, the decision of the State Government  in respect thereof shall be final. (Emphasis supplied)     4. The Tata Power Company Ltd., Respondent No. 2, had an arrangement with  Maharashtra State Electricity Board (MSEB) whereby standby capacity was being  provided by MSEB to TPC in case of emergencies in TPC’s system. In a meeting held on  29th June 1992 between TPC and REL, one of the terms of agreement in the said meeting  was that TPC may provide standby capacity to REL from standby capacity reserved by  TPC with MSEB and sharing of charges would be worked out in future.  The relevant  extract from the Minutes of the meeting reads as under :     “The interconnection is being provided to take care of emergencies in  BSES 220 KV system. Tata already have an arrangement with MSEB  whereby standby capacity is provided by MSEB to Tatas in case of   Page 3 of 22  Appeal No 3 of 2008    emergencies in Tatas system. Standby capacity to BSES may be provided  from the standby capacity reserved by Tatas with MSEB and  appropriate sharing of charges by BSES could be worked out”       5. On 28th June 1996, MSEB gave a notice to TPC, inter-alia, revising its standby  charges with effect from 1st October 1996 recoverable from TPC at the rate of Rs. 24.75  crore per month. TPC in turn revised its tariff recoverable from REL with effect from 1st  January 1997, which was protested by REL.  The standby facility to REL by TPC was to  be provided through interconnection of TPC and REL systems. The TPC’s revised tariff  order was not approved by GOM.    6. Due to dispute on commercial terms between REL and TEC, though technical  arrangements for interconnection between TEC and REL (required as part of the terms of  amendments to the license in 1992) was completed but could not be established.  The  dispute related to REL not yielding to the demand of TPC for a fixed monthly standby  charges at Rs. 450/KVA/month for availing of up to 275 MVA standby facility.    7. With a view to address the dispute between REL and TPC, the Government of  Maharashtra (GoM) appointed a Committee under the Chairmanship of Principal  Secretary (Energy) of which the representatives of MSEB, TPC and REL were members.   The representatives of TPC and REL, however, later disassociated from the committee.   The said Committee in its report dated 01 Sep 1997 reported as under:     “TEC claims that they will be commercially hit due to less purchase by  BSES (on account of Dahanu’s commissioning) and this fact needs to  be considered while deciding standby charge. Otherwise, TEC would  not achieve reasonable return in 1997-98”          Page 4 of 22  Appeal No 3 of 2008    8. The Committee further reported that;  “However, on detailed deliberation on this issue the Committee  members have agreed that the standby charges on 275 MVA demand  are payable. However, rate could be jointly decided or negotiated.”     9. Also the Committee found that the realistic financial projections for TPC and  REL revealed that while TPC was in deficit by Rs. 44.58 crores to achieve reasonable  return for the year 1997-98, REL was in surplus after payment of tax by Rs. 80.18 crores,  if special appropriations were not allowed, else their net surplus over Rate of Returns was  Rs. 52.34 crores.     10. The Committee under the head “POINTS FOR DECISION” also reported in para  2 “that while recommending actual rate (for standby charges) we have to ensure that  there is no need for any tariff revision during the current year and that the rate is  reasonable. On the basis of the assessment carried out as narrated above, standby  charges creating a burden of between Rs. 40 to 50 crores on the BSES system during the  current year would be considered reasonable for a standby of 275 MVA which will mean  a rate ranging between Rs. 225 to 300/KVA/month.",

No. 118 of 2010 in  Appeal No. 135 of 2007      Dated:  26th April, 2010     Present   : Hon’ble Mr. Justice M. Karpaga Vinayagam, Chairperson    Hon’ble Mr. Rakesh Nath, Technical Member    M/s Gimatex Industries Private Limited (in R.P. 5 & 6 / 07)  M/s Suryalaxmi Cotton Mills Limited (in R.P. 7 / 07)           … Review Petitioners    Eurotex Industries & Exports Ltd.    …. Appellant/ (s)   Versus                Maharashtra State Electricity Distribution Co. & Anr.       … Respondent (s)    Counsel for the Review Petitioner (s) :   Mr. M.M. Agnihotri              ORDER     These Review Petitions No. 5/10, 6/10 & 7/10 have been  filed against the Order dated 12.05.2008 passed by this Tribunal in  Appeal No. 135 of 2007.     The Review Petitions No. 5/10 & 6/10 have been filed by   M/s Gimatex Industries Private Limited along with an Application to  Review Petition Nos. 5, 6 & 7 of 2010 2 Condone the Delay of 563 days in filing the Review against the  Order dated 12.05.2008 passed in Appeal No. 135 of 2007.   Similarly, the other Company, namely, Suryalakshmi Cotton Mills  Limited, filed another Review Petition No. 7/10 against the said  Order along with an Application to Condone the Delay of 717 days  in filing the Review.      The Registry has raised a question with reference to the  maintainability stating that the Review Petitioners are not parties  to the proceedings before this Tribunal in Appeal No. 135 of 2007  and therefore, the Review Petitions are not maintainable.       The learned counsel for the Review Petitioners citing  several authorities to show that any aggrieved person though not a  party to the main proceedings can file a Review and seek for setting  aside of the main Order, submits that the Review  Petitions are  maintainable. It is also contended by the learned counsel for the  Review Petitioners that the delay is caused because of the fact that  the Order passed by this Tribunal in Appeal No. 135 of 2007 on  12.05.2008 did not come to the knowledge of the Review Petitioners  and only after getting a Bill they came to know about the Order of  Review Petition Nos. 5, 6 & 7 of 2010 3 the Appellate Forum and when they enquired with Distribution  Company, they came to know that the amount mentioned in the Bill  was in pursuance of the Order passed by this Tribunal in Appeal No.  135 of 2007and  that was how the delay was occurred.   Heard the learned counsel for the Review Petitioners.        These Review Petitions, in our view, are not maintainable,  and as such, they have to be dismissed on the following grounds:  1.     Admittedly, the Review Petitioners were not the parties  to  the Appeal No. 135 of 2007 disposed of by this  Tribunal on 12.05.2008.  It is contended on the basis of  the Judgment of the Supreme Court that such Order in  Appeal No. 135 of 2007 cannot be passed by this  Tribunal without hearing the parties which are  interested in the proceedings, especially when the  petitioner was a party to the proceedings before the  Commission through their Association.  Even assuming  that the petitioners can be considered to be aggrieved  parties, the ground that the principles of natural justice  have not been followed by this Tribunal cannot be a  ground for Review.    Review Petition Nos. 5, 6 & 7 of 2010 4   2.     The Review can be entertained only when (1) there is  apparent error on the face of the record; (2) some new  evidence has been brought in to upset the main order;  and (3) if there is sufficient reason.    The main ground  raised in these Review Petitions that the Order was  passed by the Tribunal in Appeal No. 135 of 2007 dated  12.05.2008 modifying the Clause 7. (4) (g) thereby  affecting the interest of the petitioners without hearing  the necessary parties named in the petition.  In our  view, the failure to give opportunity by the Tribunal to  the affected parties, who are the parties before the  Commission, cannot be a ground for the Review.     3.     Admittedly, nothing has been brought to our notice  that there is an apparent error on the face of the  record.  Similarly, it is not the case of the Petitioners  that there is some new evidence now available to show  that the main Order is patently wrong.  In the absence  of the sufficient material or ground for Review, these  Review Petitions cannot be entertained.     Review Petition Nos. 5, 6 & 7 of 2010 5   4.     It is also noticed that there is a delay of 563 days in  filing the Review Petition Nos. 5/10 & 6/10 and there is  a delay of 717 days in filing Review Petition No. 7/10.   Though the Supreme Court held that each days delay  need not be explained, we do not find any reasonable  explanation in the affidavit filed by the parties to  condone the delay, which is inordinate.  Whatever it is,  we find that there is no ground for Review as indicated  earlier. Unless, there is an apparent error on the face of  the record, the Review cannot be entertained merely on  the ground that the Order had been passed by this  Tribunal without hearing the necessary  party, as the  remedy for the same is elsewhere and not before this  Tribunal    5.     Further, it is noticed that one other party interested,  has filed a Review in I.A. No. 5 of 2008 as against the  main Order in Appeal No. 135 of 2007 before this  Tribunal and the same was dismissed on 30.04.2009.   Review Petition Nos. 5, 6 & 7 of 2010 6 So we are not inclined to take a different view from  that of the view taken in the said Order.    6.     Consequently, the Review Petitions as well s the  Petitions to condone the delay in the filing the Review  Petitions  are dismissed.               (Rakesh Nath)                      (Justice M.

Both the appeals arise out of the  same impugned order namely the order of the Uttar Pradesh  Electricity Regulatory Commission (UPERC or Commission for  short) dated 08.02.2007.  The order was passed on a Petition by  M/s. Noida Power Company Ltd. (NPCL for short), appellant in  Appeal No.36/07, under Section 86 of The Electricity Act 2003,  read with Section 34 of Uttar Pradesh Electricity Reforms Act 1999,  seeking a direction from the Commission restraining the UP Power  Corp. Ltd. (UPPCL for short) from taking any coercive action by  withdrawing 10 MW of additional power that was being supplied by  the UPPCL to the NPCL under an agreement arrived at in May,  2006.      No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                                                                Page 4 of 75                                                                            Appeal Nos. 26/2007 & 36/2007   SH    Facts:  2. From the facts available on record it appears that the parties,  namely NPCL and UPPCL, have been in perpetual conflict over the  rate on which NPCL had been getting bulk supply of electricity from  UPPCL.  NPCL obtained a license from Govt. of Uttar Pradesh for  carrying out distribution in the area of Greater Noida as a private  sector player in the distribution of electricity on 30th August, 1993.   Its entire power requirement was met by UP State Electricity Board  (UPSEB or Board for short) and there after by UPPCL, a successor  of UPSEB.  UPPCL allowed NPCL to draw power load up to 45 MW  only in view of power constraints.  The two entered into an  agreement on 15.11.1993.  UPPCL agreed to supply power of 45  MW for a maximum period of 4 ½ years.  Under the terms of the  agreement, the stipulated tentative power purchase price was  Rs.1.66 per unit.  This rate was to remain operative for only six  months.  The agreement included a term that the rate would be  subject to revision as extracted below:    “The above rates of Company are tentative which will be  studied and revised after six months by an independent  authority to be nominated by State Government and  mutually acceptable to NPCL and Supplier for this purpose.   If during the period of these six months this Body fixes  more/less charges on the basis of the above, it will be  adjusted accordingly.”    No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                                                                Page 5 of 75                                                                            Appeal Nos. 26/2007 & 36/2007   SH      3. An un-certainty about the rate of tariff payable to NPCL by  UPPCL was left in the agreement at the very inception of the  business of NPCL.  The agreement was thus pregnant with the  possibility of conflict between the two parties over the rate to be  applied for power purchase.  Since the parties could not arrive at  any mutually acceptable rates, the Govt. appointed first a  Committee known as a Nair Committee and then another known s  Beg Committee.  The report given by Beg Committee was challenged  by the NPCL before the High Court of Allahabad in Writ Petition  No.1048/2000.  In the meantime, UP Electricity Reforms Act 1999  had also come into being and UPERC was constituted vide gazette  notification dated 10.09.1998.  The UPERC had the responsibility of  determining the tariff for retail as well as bulk supply of electricity.   The High Court passed an interim order on 31.03.2000 directing  UPERC to fix the power purchase price for NPCL within ten days.   The UPERC vide an order dated 05.02.2001 fixed rates for the  period 1993-94 to 1999-2000.  NPCL also paid certain amounts as  per this determination under the order of the High Court.  The High  court heard the parties before accepting the report of the  Commission.  The Commission, for determining the tariff payable by  NPCL, had applied the principles of VIth Schedule of The Electricity  (Supply) 1948.  Since the retail tariff at which NPCL supplied  electricity to its consumers was fixed (NPCL being made to supply  electricity at the same rate at which all other consumers of the    No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                                                                Page 6 of 75                                                                            Appeal Nos. 26/2007 & 36/2007   SH    State were entitled to electricity) the principles of VIth Schedule  could be applied in reverse only.  Shri Shanti Bhushan, Sr.  Advocate then appearing for NPCL vehemently supported  application on VIth Schedule by reverse process.  The application of  VIth Schedule ensured reasonable return to the distributing  companies.  It was submitted on behalf of NPCL that following the  principles laid down in the VIth Schedule, the UPSEB would get a  reasonable price towards the cost of supply and NPCL would also  get reasonable return by making the determination on taking into  account various heads under VIth Schedule, which would balance  the equity between the two namely Board and NPCL and none  would remain in loss.  The High Court observed that the VIth  Schedule may not be applicable in literal form but the NPCL was  entitled to retain reasonable return or otherwise it will not be  possible for NPCL to survive.  The High Court approved the  application of VIth Schedule by reverse application and accepted the  report of the Commission vide judgment dated 10th November,  2005.  The Agreement between NPCL and UPPCL was for a period of  4 ½ years which would have ended in 1998. It was however  extended from time to time till 10th November, 2005.  However, the  tariff determined by the UPERC and approved by the High Court  was for the period 1993-94 to 1999-2000.  The tariffs for the  subsequent period also have been fixed by reverse application of the  VIth Schedule.",

The first agreement for High Tension supply by the Rajasthan State  Electricity Board (PSEB for short) to the respondent No.2 i.e.  Rajasthan State Mines and Minerals Ltd. (RSMML for short) is of  15th April, 1984.  The respondent No.2 continues to be a consumer  of High Tension electricity of the appellant and the contract dated  15th April, 1984 has been renewed from time to time.  The  agreement will be referred to as the HT agreement and electricity  supply under the agreement as HT supply.  The respondent No.2  set up various wind energy power plant at Barabagh in Jaisalmer  District of Rajasthan.  The Government of Rajasthan has been  promoting generation of wind energy for which the Government  issued a policy on 04.02.2000 and 03.04.2003.  Having set up the  wind energy power plant, on account of such encouragement, the  respondent No.2 entered into a wheeling and banking agreement  with the appellant on 29.08.2001.  Banking of electricity is a facility  to help small generating stations based on non-conventional energy  sources to produce power by maximizing utilization of available fuel  stock without demand restrictions.  The purchaser i.e. the  transmission licensee or distribution licensee, purchases the entire  power generated by the plant and to the extent it is in excess of the  need of the purchaser or the demand of the third parties,  the same  is, so to say, deposited or banked with the licensee which can be  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  No. of Corrections :                                                                                                                                 Page 4 of 52    Appeal No. 74 of 2007    SH  later released or returned to the generator  as and when the  generator may require.  The policy paper dated 04.02.2000 issued  by Rajasthan Energy Development Agency incorporated the clause  that the State Electricity Board will permit the power generated in a  financial year by eligible producers to be banked for the period up  to 31st March of the said financial year and that the banked energy,  if not consumed within this period would be treated to have been  sold to the RSEB at 60% of the prevailing valid HT rates.  The policy  paper also includes wheeling or transmission clauses requiring  RSEB to transmit on its grid the power generated by eligible  producers and make it available to them for their captive use or to  third party nominated by eligible producer for sale at a uniform  wheeling charge of 2% of energy wheeled.  The same provisions  reappear in the next policy paper with the only amendment that the  wheeling charges would be 10% of the energy wheeled.  By the time  the second policy paper was issued in 2003, the three distributing  companies known as Jaipur Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd., Jodhpur  Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd. and Ajmer Vidyut Vitaran Nigam Ltd.  had come into existence as successors of the RSEB for the function  of distribution of electricity.  They were briefly described as Jaipur  DISCOM, Jodhur DISCOM and Ajmer DISCOM in the policy paper.   The wheeling and banking agreement was entered into by the  respondent No.2 or RSMML with the Rajasthan Rajya Vidyut  Prasaran Nigam Ltd. or the RVPN which was the transmission  licensee at the time and with the Jodhpur DISCOM and Ajmer  _____________________________________________________________________________________________  No. of Corrections :                                                                                                                                 Page 5 of 52    Appeal No. 74 of 2007    SH  DISCOM (the appellant).  This agreement was entered into for an  initial term of 20 years.  The RSMML, under the agreement, is  entitled to make use of the power generated by it for its captive  consumption at its industrial units or to sell to third parties after  paying wheeling charges @ 2% to RVPNL and to wheel the energy to  any place within the jurisdiction of the appellant or the Jodhpur  DISCOM.  RVPN was obliged to bank in a financial year up to 31st  March of the financial year.  The respondent No.2, RSMML was to  bear the entire cost of grid interfacing including laying of HT lines  from the point of generation to the nearest HT line of the Jodhpur  DISCOM i.e. up to the technically feasible point.  RSMML required  energy at the wind farm for back up purposes.  Meters were  stipulated to be installed at the point of export of power to the grid  and another for import from the grid.  The meter for measuring  outgoing energy i.e. power delivered by RSMML to RVPN was  required to be installed at delivery point.

This appeal is directed against the order of the Madhya  Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission dated 06.05.08 by  which the Commission directed the appellant (developers) to file a  petition for determination of generation tariff with full particulars as  required as per CERC norms and MPERC Regulations by 30.06.08.   The order was passed in Petition No. 138 of 2005 in the matter of  approval of Power Sale Agreement between PTC India Ltd. and  Madhya Pradesh Electricity Board for sale of power from Lanco      No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                     Page 3 of 19    Appeal No. 71 of 2008    SH  Amarkantak Thermal Power Station being set up at Patadi, Korba in  Chhattisgarh.    Facts in brief:   2. The Lanco Amarkantak Power Pvt. Ltd., the appellant is an  electricity generating company having a coal based thermal power  station in District Korba, Chhattisgarh.  By a Power Purchase  Agreement (PPA for short), between the appellant and the  respondent No.3, dated 11.05.05 the appellant and the respondent  No.3 contracted to sale and purchase of 300 MW of power.  On 30th  May, 2005, the respondent No.3 entered into Power Sale Agreement  (PSA for short) with the respondent No.2 which is also a trading  company in the State of Madhya Pradesh.  On 16.11.05, the  predecessor of respondent No.2 filed a petition before Madhya  Pradesh Electricity Regulatory Commission (the Commission for  short) for approval of power supply agreement between respondent  No.3 and respondent No.2.  Vide an order dated 14.12.05, the  Commission opined that fixation of cost of generation of a generator  situated outside the State of Madhya Pradesh is not within its  purview.  Nonetheless, it directed that the appellant’s generating  station should voluntarily submit itself to the jurisdiction of  Commission and submit its Detailed Project Report for scrutiny.   The appellant vide its letter dated 19.01.06, addressed to the      No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                     Page 4 of 19    Appeal No. 71 of 2008    SH  respondent No.3, expressed its willingness to supply information  and clarifications required by respondent No.3 to be submitted to  the Commission and also expressed its willingness to abide by the  direction of the Commission generally and with the overall  guidelines of the Central Electricity Regulatory Commission.    3. Vide an order dated 07.03.08, the Commission granted  conditional and provisional approval to the PSA between respondent  No.3 and respondent No.2 subject to the fulfillment of certain  conditions.  One of the conditions was that the appellant would  submit to the jurisdiction of the Commission.  It further directed  that the appellant would file a petition for determination of tariff  under the PPA.    4. Vide a letter dated 14.03.08, the appellant terminated the PPA.   The time allocated to the appellant for submission of the tariff  petition was extended first upto 30.04.08 and then to 04.10.08.   The High Court of Madhya Pradesh at Jabalpur stayed the  termination of the PPA vide an order dated 31.03.08 in WP No. 4103  of 2008.  The appellant vide an affidavit dated 30.04.08 submitted  before the Commission, disputed the Commission’s jurisdiction in  the matter of fixing tariff of the appellant under the PPA.          No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                     Page 5 of 19    Appeal No. 71 of 2008    SH  Impugned Order:   5. Vide an order dated 06.05.08, the Commission held that it had  the jurisdiction to determine the tariff for the PPA and that it had  the jurisdiction to examine and redetermine the levelised tariff  contractually stipulated in the PPA.  The Commission further  directed that till such time the tariff was determined a provisional  tariff of 95% of the levelised tariff indicated in the PPA would be  leviable.    The grounds for challenge and decision:   6. The sole challenge to the impugned order is based on the plea  that the Commission did not have jurisdiction to direct the  appellant to file a tariff petition.  The respondent No.3 in its reply to  the appeal has opposed the appeal.  However, the respondent No.3  concede the objection of the appellant that the Commission could  not have directed the appellant, which is a generating company, to  submit its petition for fixation of tariff for supplying to the  respondent No.3, PTC which is a power trading licensee.  The  respondent No.2 on the other hand has filed a counter affidavit  supporting the direction of the Commission and contending that the  Commission had the jurisdiction to pass the impugned order.        No. of Corrections:                                                                                                                                     Page 6 of 19    Appeal No. 71 of 2008    SH  7. This Tribunal has already gone into the issue in the case of  Gajendra Haldea Vs. Central Electricity Regulatory Commission &  Others in Petition No.1 of 2005 reported in 2008 Energy Law  Reporter (APTEL 203).  This Tribunal went into the interpretation of  Section 62 of the Act which is as under:     “62. Determination of tariff:  (1) The Appropriate Commission shall determine  the tariff in accordance with the provisions of  this Act for–  (a) supply of electricity by a generating company to  a distribution licensee: PROVIDED that the  Appropriate Commission may, in case of  shortage of supply of electricity, fix the  minimum and maximum ceiling of tariff for sale  or purchase of electricity in pursuance of an  agreement, entered into between a generating  company and a licensee or between licensees,  for a period not exceeding one year to ensure  reasonable prices of electricity;  (b) transmission of electricity;  (c) wheeling of electricity;  (d) retail sale of electricity",

Chahal,  Advocates       Order under section 123 of Electricity Act 2003           The two appeals viz. the appeal Nos. 26/2007 & 36/2007 arise  out of the same impugned order viz the one dated 08 Feb. 2007  passed on a petition filed by the Noida Power Company Ltd  (NPCL for short).  The detailed facts of the case are available in  the two judgments of the two members of the bench.  For the  purpose of the present order under section 123 Electricity Act  2003, we need to place only the basic facts.                                                                                               Page 2 of 12      Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007  2. NPCL contracted to purchase 10 MW of power from UPPCL  on marginal cost.  The UPPCL commenced supply of 10 MW  w.e.f. 10 May 2006 and raised the bill for this supply for the first  time in September 2006.  Subsequently in November 2007  UPPCL revised the bill.  The NPCL found the rate charged being  higher than its expectations and defaulted in paying the bill.   UPPCL vide its letter dated 04 Nov. 2001 threatened to  discontinue the additional supply of power and restrict the  power supply to the original 45 MW for which the parties had an  existing power purchase agreement.  This led to filing a petition  No.414 by NPCL to UPERC under Section 86 of the Electricity  Act 2003 and Section 34 of the U.P. Electricity Reforms Act  1999.  In the proceedings  before the Commission, the NPCL  made Additional Submissions on 16 Nov. 2006 seeking certain  reliefs.     3. The Commission despite having found the transaction  being costliest proceeded to consider it as a ‘sunk cost’ as it was  fait accompli, and directed vide impugned order that NPCL  should compensate the cost incurred by the UPPCL by making  payment to it at the rate of marginal cost as claimed by the  UPPCL.  However, in order to balance the higher cost for 10 MW  to be borne by the NPCL it further directed that for the original  45 MW of power bulk supply tariff fixed earlier should be  reduced and the NPCL should pay for the bulk supply of 45 MW  at the rate of 1.987 per unit.  While UPPCL is aggrieved of the                                                                                             Page 3 of 12      Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007  order reducing the bulk supply tariff rate for the 45 MW power  the NPCL is aggrieved with the order directing it to pay for the 10  MW of additional power at marginal cost for being ‘sunk cost’.   Both the members are of the opinion that the Commission could  not have altered the bulk supply tariff for the original 45 MW of  power which had been fixed by an earlier tariff order.  However,  they are at divergence about the price to be paid for the  additional 10 MW.    4. One of us, the Judicial Member, has found that the appeal  of UPPCL has to be allowed and that of NPCL dismissed.  The  rationale for such finding is as under.    5. NPCL challenged the impugned order on the following  grounds:    i) The agreement dated 08.05.2006 was obtained  by UPPCL from NPCL by undue influence as  defined under Section 16 of the Contract Act and  did not amount to a contract under Section 10.    ii) The claim of UPPCL to charge power supply to one  distribution company in the State @ Rs.8.80 per  unit while it is supplying to all other distribution  companies in the State at the rate of Rs.1.897 per  unit is clearly discriminatory and un- constitutional.                                                                                               Page 4 of 12      Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007  iii) The agreement dated 08.05.2006 was contrary to  law and therefore not binding and enforceable  under Section 23 of The Contract Act.      iv) UPPLC being a State transmission utility is not  permitted to trade in electricity.    v) There is no clear concept of marginal cost.  Therefore so called agreement dated 08.05.06  could not amount to a valid contract”      6. The Judicial Member finds that order dated 08 May 2006  was a valid contract and not hit by either Section 16 or by  Section 23 of the Contract Act.  She also finds that the marginal  cost contract was not discriminatory.  So far as UPPCL’s  function as a trader is concerned, the Judicial Member finds it to  be irrelevant to the controversy.  She finds the concept of  marginal cost generally understood and clear and particularly  defined by the letter of  dated 10 May 2006 of the UPPCL and  that the parties fully understood what they were agreeing to and  hence the contract was not bad for uncertainty.  The Judicial  Member also holds that dominant position heretofore enjoyed by  UPPCL being the transmission utility and by denying open  access had come to an end in January 2006 when open access  was made available to NPCL as evidenced by letter of 13 Jan.  2006 of the UPPCL.  She finds that NPCL, despite availability of  open access as well as offers from other suppliers for additional  electricity, opted to enter into the agreement with UPPCL for  supply of 10 MW at marginal cost.   The Judicial Member also                                                                                             Page 5 of 12      Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007  holds that NPCL was not a company which could be entitled to  succeed to any of the power purchase agreements  held by the  erstwhile UP State Electricity Board.  The Judicial Member  further holds that the transaction in question is not hit by  Section 60 of the Electricity Act 2003.    7. The Judicial Member further finds that NPCL never alleged  that the impugned agreement had any adverse effect on  competition and that the presumed dominant position of UPPCL  had no adverse effect on competition so far as the transaction in  question is concerned.  Further she finds that no ‘directions’  under Section 60 of the Electricity Act 2003 can be issued to  deny the seller the contracted price after the sale is complete  and the product consumed.  The conclusion of the Judicial  Member is as under :    “73. To summarise the above discussion, I say that  the contract of 08th May, 2006 was legal and valid and  for the purchase of power under the agreement, NPCL  is legally bound to pay the agreed price.  Even if the  objections to the validity of the contract are sustained,  the NPCL has to compensate the UPPCL and such  compensation would be the same as marginal price as  held by the Commission.  No mistake in the calculation  of marginal cost having been pointed out, the NPCL is  bound to pay the amount for which UPPCL raised the  bill. The impugned order to this extent has to be upheld.   The part of the order which amends the bulk supply  tariff for 45 MW cannot be sustained and has to be set  aside”.                                                                                               Page 6 of 12      Appeal Nos. 26 & 36 of 2007  8. One of us (Technical member), on the other hand, in a  separate judgment has taken a view that the ‘marginal cost’ as  defined by the Forum of Regulators deals with a view to establish  surcharge for open access and is applicable to distribution  licensees to supply power to consumers and not to a bulk supply  of power to licensees, as in the instant case, particularly when  the distribution licensees are not having access to power  procurement independent of UPPCL.  Even otherwise, he opines  that the said definition of ‘the marginal cost of purchase of  electricity to be equated to the highest purchase cost of utility  including fixed and variable costs’ does not make us any wiser  and cannot be implemented unless it is further qualified by  differentiating the purchases in terms of cost; peaking/non- peaking hours; UI purchase, etc.  On the contrary, he holds that  the ‘marginal cost’ per unit is the costliest power purchased by  UPPCL for all procurement (excluding the UI charges when the  grid frequency has dipped below minimum permissible limit)  aggregating over 400 MW during each unit of time-period, it  procured and supplied additional power to UPPCL, thus,  deciding that the fair price of 10 MW should be at the average  pool rate of incremental procurement of over 400 MW by UPPCL.",

L. Bajaj, Technical Member    Hon’ble Mrs. Justice Manju Goel, Judicial Member      IN THE MATTER OF:  Punjab State Electricity Board  The Mall,  Patiala, Punjab – 147 001    …applicant(s)/appellant    Versus    1. Punjab State Electricity Regulatory Commission    SCO No.220-221, Sector 34A,   Chandigarh – 160 022.    2. Gujarat Ambuja Cement Ltd.   Through its General Manager   Vill. Nuhon, P.O. Laudi Majra,   Distt. Ropar,   Punjab – 140 113      …Respondents     Counsel for the applicant(s) : Mr. Rupinder Suri         Ms. Suruchi Suri         Er. J. P. Singh, Director, TR-II         Er. Sham Lal, DD, Resp. No.4    Counsel for the respondents : Mr. Rohit Singh for Resp. No.2         Mr. G. Umapathy for Resp.   No.2    Page 2 of 5    IA No. 156 of 2007    SH         Mr. J. C. Shukla, Registrar,   PSERC  Mr. Raghvinder Singh, Asstt.  Director, PSERC      O R D E R    The present application seeks condonation of delay in filing an  appeal to challenge the order dated 04.08.06 passed by the Punjab  State Electricity Regulatory Commission.  The delay till the date of  filing is of 106 days.  The appeal was returned by the Registry for  removing certain defects.  The appeal thereafter was re-filed and in  re-filing there is a delay of 117 days.  The interlocutory application  which does not take care of the delay in re-filing deals with delay of  106 days.  It is stated that the delay was caused as the file was  being moved within the appellant’s department for preparation of  review and subsequently in presenting the appeal.  It may be stated  here that the appellant/applicant had first attempted to obtain the  intended relief by filing a review petition but did not succeed as the  same was found to be not maintainable.    2) Coming to the re-filing it is stated that the appeal was  returned on account of the objections which has been raised  keeping in view the changes introduced by a notification dated  22.01.07 under the APTEL (Forms, Verification and the Fee for  Filing an Appeal) Rules 2004, that fresh drafts prepared by the    Page 3 of 5    IA No. 156 of 2007    SH  counsel got lost in post and thereafter another copy of the draft had  to be sent by the counsel which caused the delay.  Another affidavit  has been filed by the appellant stating therein as to how the 106  days were spent by different sections of the applicant and  attempted to explain the delay.  It may be mentioned here further  that much of the delay is attributed to the fact that the applicant is  based in Patiala whereas the counsel responsible for filing the  appeal is based in Delhi.    3) The application is opposed by the respondent who says that  sufficient ground has not been made out and the application is an  abuse of the process of the court.  In the reply it is contended that  the impugned order is justified and that despite rejection of the  review petition the appellant has taken a long time to come to this  Tribunal and therefore the delay should not be condoned.      4) So far as re-filing is concerned, the loss of draft in post cannot  be attributed to the negligence of the appellant or the counsel.   Although the reply has been filed the truth of the allegations in the  two affidavits has not been disputed.  Therefore, so far as re-filing is  concerned the delay has to be excused.    5) So far as the filing is concerned the delay is of 106 days.  Although the respondent objected to condonation of delay, it does  not dispute the facts alleged in the affidavit.It cannot be denied that    Page 4 of 5    IA No. 156 of 2007    SH  there is a need to improve the functioning of public sector  undertakings in the matter of pursuing litigations.  The Supreme  Court in several judgments have talked about the delay made by  the State mechanisms.  In the case of State of Nagaland Vs. Lipok  AO and Others 2005 (3) SCC 752 the Supreme Court stated that the  State as an impersonal machinery working through its officers and  servants cannot be put on the same footing as an individual.   Further the Supreme Court advised that the public interest is also  involved when matters are pursued by the State.  Although we  would have been happier if the appellant/applicant had shown  more diligence in approaching this Tribunal.  We cannot say that  the delay has not been explained or that the cause is not sufficient.      6) In a recent case, in the case of Sainik Security Vs. Sheel Bhai &  Others 2008 AIR SCW 1948, the Supreme Court on being satisfied  that there was sufficient ground condoned the delay but imposed a  cost as a condition precedents for condoning the delay.  In view of  the facts in the present case as explained above we think it will be  appropriate to condone the delay but subject to some cost in order  to compensate the respondent for the loss of time.  Accordingly, we  allow the application for condonation of delay subject to a cost of  Rs.5,000/- (Rupees Five Thousand Only) which should be deposited  before the next date of hearing.      Page 5 of 5    IA No. 156 of 2007    SH  7) The appeal be listed for hearing on July 28, 2008.   Meanwhile, the appeal will be numbered after the cost is deposited.    8) Pronounced in open court on this 08th day of May, 2008.    ( Justice Manju Goel )        ( H. L.

The petitioner, who is the appellant in the appeal no. 82 of 2007, has  filed an application under section 122(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003  seeking to review and rectify order dated 10.1.08 passed by this Tribunal in  respect of the following:    (a) In the operative part of the order at paragraph 5 concerning  station heat rate and in paragraph 6 relating to rebate for timely  payment are to be made applicable not only for the FY 2006-07 but  also to FY 2005-06 and all earlier years.    Deepak 1   2. We have heard the learned counsel on behalf of petitioner and    the respondents. In respect of issue 1(a) stated above, it is clarified  that  the appeal has challenged the impugned order dated 22.9.06 vide which  the Commission had decided the ARR and tariff applicable to the  appellant (the present petitioner) for generation and sale of electricity  from its three power plants for the FY 2006-07.  The petitioner had also filed  a review petition before the Commission being no. 54 of 2006 which was  dismissed vide the impugned order dated 30.3.2007.  It is made clear here  that the appeal was confined to the tariff for the FY 2006-07 and truing up  of the financial for the previous year i.e. 2005-06.  The impugned order  approving the Annual Review Requirements (ARR) and approval of tariff  for the period 2006-07 by the Commission necessarily involved truing up  exercise of the tariff order for the previous year.  The Commission has the  truing up undertaken using the provisional accounts for the year 2005-06  and in various technical sessions with the petitioner had validated the  data submitted.      3. The analysis of ARR against the tariff petition 03 of  2006 for FY 2006- 07 was carried out by the Commission.  The Commission stated to have  held various technical sessions with the petitioner to validate the data  submitted and was asked to submit the actual data for FY 2005-06 based  on audited account.   The Petitioner had submitted actual for FY 2005-06  based on provisional accounts of 1st April, 2005 to September, 2005.  The  six month’s data was taken as the basis for working out the revised  estimate for the FY 2005-06.  The truing up exercise involved reviewing the  revised estimates with prudence check by the Commission and would  lead to re-fixation of some of the expenses and revenue for FY 2005-06.    The appeal is related to the tariff order for FY 2006-07.  The Tariff Order for  Deepak 2 Deepak 3 2005-06 had already attained finality as it was not challenged by the  Petitioner and only the truing up of the revenue and the expenses based  on the actual data as well as its scrutiny by the Commission remained to  be done.      4. In view of the above in our judgment and order dated 10.01.2008  the consideration of issues concerning the Heat Rate and Rebate on  timely payment was limited only the tariff order for FY 2006-07 and not for  2005-06 or earlier years. The judgment and order may have made  reference to 2005-06 only for analyzing the issues raised for 2006-07.  We  therefore, reject the contentions of the petitioner for applicability of our  decision on station heat rate and rebate for timely payment for FY 2005-06  or for earlier years.       5. In view of the above, the Review Petition 3 of 2008 is disposed of.        (Manju Goel)                                         (A.A.

Review Petition No  2007 of 81 . in Appeal No     Dated:  May 9, 2008    Present:   Hon’ble Mr. A.A. Khan, Technical Member                Hon’ble Mrs. Justice Manju Goel, Judicial Member    Indraprastha Power Generation Co. Ltd.        -Review Petitioner(s)      Versus    Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission & Ors.       -Respondent(s)      Counsel for the Review Petitioner(s)       :  Mr. M.G. Ramachandran with    Mr. Anand K. Ganesan and    Ms. Swapna Seshadri    Counsel for the Respondent(s)                : Mr. Mohit Jolly for NDPL  Mr. R.K. Mehta with Mr. Mragank for  DERC  Mr. V.P. Singh and Mr. Anuj Berry for  BRPL &BYPL      Ms. Shradha Jain for DTL                                                           ORDER    1.  The petitioner, who is the appellant in the appeal no. 81 of 2007, has  filed an application under section 122(2) of the Electricity Act, 2003  seeking to review and clarification of the order dated 10.1.08 passed by  this Tribunal in respect of the following:    (a) The directions in the operative part of the order at paragraph  15 concerning station heat rate and in paragraph 16 relating to  rebate for timely payment are to be made applicable not only for  the FY 2006-07 but also for truing up for FY 2005-06 and all earlier  years.  Deepak 1 (b) The applicant has claimed that the impugned order does not  address the issue related to PLF target for recovery of fixed cost in  respect of Indraprastha Power Station, Rajghat Power Station and  Indraprastha Gas Power Station.  The petitioner states that the  Commission’s tariff order has fixed the station wise generating  target and calculated the fixed cost and variable cost per unit  based on the above generation target.  It is further stated that in  the concluding paragraphs of the tariff order, the Commission had  wrongly taken the fixed cost recovery equivalent to higher target  availability fixed for payment of incentive.  It says that the  Commission’s tariff order is inconsistent in its concluding paragraphs  as the Commission had taken for the purpose of fixed cost recovery  target availability at a higher level though the State Commission  itself has fixed the target for recovery of fixed cost at a lower level.   The Petitioner requests for removal of discrepancy.     2. We have heard the learned counsel on behalf of petitioner and    the respondents. In respect of issue 1(a) stated above, it is clarified  that  the appeal has challenged the impugned order dated 22.9.06 vide which  the Commission had decided the ARR and tariff applicable to the  appellant (the present petitioner) for generation and sale of electricity  from its three power plants for the FY 2006-07.  The petitioner had also filed  a review petition before the Commission being no. 54 of 2006 which was  dismissed vide the impugned order dated 30.3.2007.  It is made clear here  that the appeal was confined to the tariff for the FY 2006-07 and truing up  of the financial for the previous year i.e. 2005-06.  The impugned order  approving the Annual Review Requirements (ARR) and approval of tariff  for the period 2006-07 by the Commission necessarily involved truing up  exercise of the tariff order for the previous year.  The Commission has  Deepak 2 undertaken  truing up  using the provisional accounts for the year 2005-06  and in various technical sessions with the petitioner had validated the  data submitted.      3. The analysis of ARR against the tariff petition 02 of 2006 for FY 2006- 07 was carried out by the Commission.  The Commission stated to have  held various technical sessions with the petitioner to validate the data  submitted and was asked to submit the actual data for FY 2005-06 based  on audited account.   The Petitioner had submitted actual’s   for FY 2005- 06 based on provisional accounts of 1st April, 2005 to September, 2005.   The six month’s data was taken as the basis for working out the revised  estimate for the FY 2005-06.  The truing up exercise involved reviewing the  revised estimates with prudence check by the Commission and would  lead to re-fixation of some of the expenses and revenue for FY 2005-06.    The appeal is related to the tariff order for FY 2006-07 and truing up for  2005-06 .  The Tariff Order for 2005-06 had already attained finality as it was  not challenged by the Petitioner and only the truing up of the revenue  and the expenses based on the actual data as well as its scrutiny by the  Commission remained to be done.      4. In view of the above in our judgment and order dated 10.01.2008  the consideration of issues concerning the Heat Rate and Rebate on  timely payment was limited only to the tariff order for FY 2006-07 and not  for 2005-06 or earlier years. The judgment and order has made reference  to 2005-06 only for analyzing the issues raised for 2006-07.  We therefore,  reject the contentions of the petitioner for applicability of our decision on  station heat rate and rebate for timely payment for FY 2005-06 or for  earlier years.     Deepak 3 Deepak 4 5. As regards the issue raised in para 1(b) above it is clarified that full  fixed recovery is only to be tagged to target availability whereas the  payment of incentive is related to targeted PLF as per the relevant  regulations and the operations norms.  The PLF derived from the gross  generation from the station cannot be treated as target PLF.  The issue  raised is covered in  paras 18 and 19 of our order.     6. The Appellant had stated that the total fixed costs estimates as per  the Petitioner’s submissions and as allowed by Commission has been  summarized in table 3.20 of para 3.13.7 of the impugned tariff order.  The  said table reflecting the total fixed costs estimates is based on the PLF  accepted by the Commission based on gross generation from tables 3.4,  3.7 and 3.10 of the impugned order for three generating stations.   The  petitioner further points out that the aforesaid fixed cost estimates are  inconsistent with the Commission’s decision to provide recovery of fixed  costs based on target availability of 50% for IP Stations and 70% for GTPS  etc. The Petitioner has also pointed out that it has in its Appeal that it has  already sought clarification from the Commission for this mismatch and no  response has been received so far.  The learned counsel for the  Commission Mr. R.K. Mehta has undertaken to ensure consideration and  disposal of the aforesaid clarification.     8. Let the Commission dispose of the prayer for clarification made by  the appellant.  We hope that the appellant will be satisfied by the  Commission’s clarification.  We dispose of the Review Petition no. 2 of 2008  while providing the appellant with yet another opportunity to make an  appropriate application before us in case it is not satisfied with the  Commission’s clarification.

Appellant  Through: Mr. Arvind Vashistha, Advocate with  appellant in person.         versus     JAI SOLANKI      ..... Respondent      Through: None.      CORAM:  HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE HIMA KOHLI  HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA       O R D E R  %   05.07.2017    1. The appellant is aggrieved by the judgment dated 14.09.2016 passed  by the learned Principal Judge, Family Court, North-West District, Rohini  Court, Delhi, allowing a petition filed by her husband, the respondent  seeking dissolution of their marriage on the ground of cruelty.   2. Briefly stated, the facts of the case are that the parties got married at  Delhi as per the Hindu rites and ceremonies on 24.02.2012. There is no issue  from the marriage.  As per the averments made by the respondent in his  petition, the appellant was welcomed in the family but her behaviour  towards him and his family member was cruel; that she ill-treated and  humiliated the respondent and his family members; that whenever he                           visited  the  house  of  his in-laws, he was humiliated and ill-treated by them;                        MAT.APP.(F.C.) 83/2017                                                                         Page 2 of 11            that the appellant did not do any household chores; that she kept nagging the   respondent and kept pressuring him to live independently and not in joint  family, causing him mental tension and agony. The appellant had even  threatened to commit suicide and implicate the family members of the  respondent in a false dowry case.    3. In the third week of August, 2012, when the respondent went to  Rajasthan for office work, the appellant took away all her jewellery and  valuables and also his certificates and personal documents in his absence,  and left the matrimonial home.  In October, 2012, when the respondent was  in Rajasthan, he received a telephonic call from the CAW Cell, Dwarka,  Delhi informing him that a complaint had been filed by the appellant against  him.  The respondent joined the proceedings and with the intervention of the  relatives and well-wishers, both the parties decided to shift to some other  place, other than the matrimonial home where the respondent was residing  with his parents. However, the appellant resided with the respondent at the  alternate residential accommodation arranged by him at Najafgarh only for  one day and again left.    4.  On 25.10.2012, the appellant yet again filed a complaint against the  respondent before the CAW Cell, wherein she alleged that Ms. Monika, her  sister-in-law (Jethani) and Ms. Jyoti (Nanad) were involved in prostitution.  The respondent averred in the pleadings that copies of the said complaint  were distributed by the appellant in the locality and she alongwith her  mother and brother had visited his workplace and insulted him before his  superior officer. The respondent then filed a petition for seeking dissolution  of his marriage with the appellant on the ground of cruelty.      MAT.APP.(F.C.) 83/2017                                                                         Page 3 of 11          5. The divorce petition was contested by the appellant. She filed the  written statement wherein it was pleaded that despite the fact that an amount  of Rs.66 lakhs was spent in the marriage and a huge amount was given in  dowry, she was harassed, tortured and beaten by the respondent on one  pretext or the other; that the respondent suffered from venereal disease,  which he had communicated to her; that in the last month of her stay with  the respondent at the matrimonial home, she was subjected to intense cruelty  by him and his family members and her Chacha Sasur, namely, Randhir and  Tau Sasur, namely, Balwant had attempted to outrage her modesty.  It was  averred that finally, on 02.11.2012, the respondent had assaulted the  appellant and thrown her out of the matrimonial home.   6. After the pleadings were completed in the petition and issues were  framed, the parties were called upon to lead the evidence.  To substantiate  his case, the respondent/husband had examined three witnesses, whereas the  appellant had examined herself as the sole witness.  In his affidavit by way  of evidence, the respondent, who appeared as PW-1, reiterated the  averments made by him in the divorce petition and specifically stated in para  23 thereof as follows:-  “23. That the respondent has again filed a false vague and  wrong complaint against the deponent before the CAW cell,  Rohini only to blackmail and pressurize him to knee down to  settle the matter on her terms.  She has alleged the allegation in  her complaint that “MERI NAND JYOTI, MERA PATI JAI  SOLANKI AND MONIKA MERE KO GALAT KAM KARWANE  (PROSTITUTION) KE LIYE LE JANE KA DABAB DALTE  HAI. MERI NAND JYOTI AUR JETHANI MONIKA GALT  KAM KARTE HAI AUR MUJHE BHI KISHI KI GADDI MAI  BAITHANE KI KAUSHIS KI”.  Copies of this complaint has  also distribute in the locality of deponent and due to allegation    MAT.APP.(F.C.) 83/2017                                                                         Page 4 of 11          the life of deponent has become hell. Copy of complaint filed by  respondent in CAW Cell Rohini is Exhibited as Mark-A.”    7. The respondent’s father had entered the witness box as PW-2 and his  employer had appeared as PW-3. Both the said witnesses had supported his  case.  On her part, the appellant filed her affidavit by way of evidence,  wherein she had reiterated the averments made by her in the written  statement to the effect that she was threatened by her mother-in-law and   sisters-in-law and that her Chacha Sasur and Tau Sasur, Shri Randhir and  Shri Balwan had tried to rape her.   8.  On examining the entire evidence, both ocular and documentary, the  learned Principal Judge, Family Court had observed that serious allegations  were levelled  by the appellant against the brothers of her father-in-law as  she had deposed that both of them had tried to rape her in the presence of  her mother-in-law and sister-in-law. In her complaint dated 20.01.2014  (Ex.PW2/1) addressed to the learned MM, the appellant had made similar  allegations and thereafter failed to pursue the said complaint and had made a  statement to the said effect before the learned MM on 19.03.2014,  withdrawing her allegations of receiving beatings and the attempt allegedly  made to rape her.  The appellant also sought pardon from the Court and  stated that she would lodge a separate FIR in respect of the aforesaid  allegations. It has been particularly observed in the impugned judgment that  no such FIR was placed on record by the appellant levelling the aforesaid  allegations against the respondent and his family members.    9. Given the aforesaid facts and circumstances, the documents brought  on record and the testimony of PW-1, PW-2 and PW-3, which had remained     MAT.APP.(F.C.) 83/2017                                                                         Page 5 of 11          unassailed   during   their   cross-examination   conducted  on  behalf  of  the   appellant, the learned Principal Judge, Family Court concluded that the  conduct of the appellant was cruel towards the respondent and his family  members as she had levelled false and scandalous allegations against them,  which were not taken to a logical conclusion and instead, they were  withdrawn midway. The above clearly indicated that the appellant was not  serious about the said allegations and had made them in an irresponsible  fashion, solely to defame the respondent and his family members.    10. In view of the above, the issue framed with regard to the entitlement  of the respondent herein to the relief of a decree of divorce was decided in  his favour and it was held in the impugned judgment that the appellant had  treated her husband with cruelty. As a result, the marriage of the parties was  dissolved and a decree of divorce was granted in favour of the respondent  under Section 13(1)(i-a) of the HMA Act. Aggrieved by the aforesaid  decision, the appellant has filed the present appeal.  11. The leitmotif of the arguments addressed by learned counsel for the  appellant to assail the impugned judgment is that the learned Principal  Judge, Family Court had grossly erred in taking into consideration the  appellant’s complaint before the CAW Cell, Dwarka, Delhi, as it has all  along been her stand that the said complaint was never filed by her and it did  not bear her signatures.    12. We may note that in her cross-examination, the appellant as RW-1,    had categorically stated that she had filed the complaint alongwith her  petition under Section 125 Cr.PC (Ex.RW-1/DA) and then gone on to state  that  she  did  not remember if the said complaint (Ex.RW-1/DB) is the same     MAT.APP.(F.C.) 83/2017                                                                         Page 6 of 11            complaint, which she had filed with her petition under Section 125 Cr.PC. In   other words, the appellant did not deny having filed a complaint alongwith",

Respondents  Through:  Mr. L.K. Tyagi, Advocate for  R-2.    Ms. Neerja Sachdeva, Adv. for  R-4.    CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA       JUDGMENT (ORAL)  1. Shiv Pratap Singh, the appellant in MAC APP.104/2009  (hereinafter referred to as the claimant), had instituted an accident    MAC Appeal No. 66/2009 & 104/2009     Page 2 of 5      claim case on 30.10.1995, seeking compensation invoking Sections  163-A and 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988, it having been  registered as claim case No.746/1995 by the Motor Accident Claims  Tribunal (Tribunal).  It was stated in the said claim petition that on  22.05.1995 a motor vehicular accident took place at about 09:30 p.m.  on Delhi Mathura Road near Chatta Sugar Mill, District Mathura  involving two vehicles, they being Maruti van No.DL-4CB-1361 (the  van hereinafter) and tanker bearing no.DL-1GA-0328 (tanker). While  the claimant was concededly the driver of the van moving from Delhi  towards Agra carrying certain other persons, the tanker was moving  ahead of it.  It was alleged that Jasbir Singh, shown in the array as the  driver and owner of the tanker, had suddenly applied brakes, stopping  his vehicle in the middle of the road without any prior caution. On  account of such negligent driving, the van was involved in a collision  resulting in injuries being suffered, amongst others, by the claimants.  The petition was later amended so as to join United India Assurance  Company Limited, the insurer of the tanker, as respondent no.2. The  van which the claimant was driving was owned at the relevant point of  time by Satpal Singh Chawla, he having been impleaded as third  respondent before the Tribunal, it being insured against third party risk  for the relevant period with M/s. New India Assurance Company  Limited (appellant in MAC APP.66/2009).  2. The Tribunal held inquiry and, by its judgment dated  18.02.2006, declined to grant any compensation dismissing the  petition holding, inter alia, that the claimant had not been able to    MAC Appeal No. 66/2009 & 104/2009     Page 3 of 5      prove that he had sustained injuries on account of rash or negligent  driving of the tanker.   3. The claimant came to this court by MAC APP.480/2006 which  was allowed by judgment dated 9 th  July, 2008 holding the finding  returned by the Tribunal to be perverse remanding the matter for a  fresh decision particularly in view of the fact that the insurance  company had come up with the plea of contributory negligence as one  of the defences.        4. In the inquiry held after such remand, evidence was led. The  inquiry eventually resulted in judgment dated 01.10.2008 whereby  claim for compensation was upheld and on the basis of finding  returned concerning the nature of injuries and the loss suffered,  compensation in the sum of Rs.6,03,600/- was awarded.  The Tribunal  held that it was a case of composite liability on the part of both the  vehicles (i.e. the van and the tanker) and, therefore, fastened the  liability on the first and third respondents, mentioned above, in equal  proportion holding, in turn, their respective insurers to indemnify  directing compliance to be made within thirty days of such order.   5. The insurer of the van has come up in appeal (MAC  APP.66/2009) pressing it on a very short point, i.e., the claimant was  not a third party in its relation and, therefore, it had no liability to  discharge.   6. The claimant, on the other hand, has come up with his appeal  (MAC APP.104/2009) seeking enhancement of compensation. Though    MAC Appeal No. 66/2009 & 104/2009     Page 4 of 5      at one stage, the counsel for the claimant try to argue that the claim  was wrongly treated as one brought under Section 163-A of the Motor  Vehicles Act, 1988, the evidence having been led on the question of  negligence as well, and that the Tribunal should have considered it to  be a case for compensation under the Section 166 of the Act, after  some arguments, the learned counsel for the claimant submitted, on  instructions, that he may be allowed to withdraw the said appeal.  7. In view of the above submissions, the appeal of the claimant  Shiv Pratap Singh (MAC APP.104/2009) is dismissed as withdrawn.   8. The counsel for the second respondent (M/s. United India  Assurance Company Limited), it being the insurer of the tanker,  submitted at the hearing that since the Tribunal has held it to be a case  of composite liability, even if the insurer of the van (i.e., appellant in  MAC APP.66/2009) were not accountable, the case being not of a  third party, the owner of the van, i.e., Sat Pal Singh Chawla (the third  respondent) must bear his liability.   9. The learned counsel for the claimant fairly agreed that the  claimant would not stand in the capacity of a third party in relation to  the appellant insurer of the van since he being in use of the vehicle as  the driver for and on behalf of the owner (the insured), his claim  cannot stand against the insurer whose liability to indemnify is  restricted to claims of third parties.  He, however, submitted that since  it is a case of composite liability, the insurer of the tanker may be  called upon to pay the entire amount though it may be given recovery  rights against the owner of the van.     MAC Appeal No. 66/2009 & 104/2009     Page 5 of 5      10. It is clear from the record that Sat Pal Singh Chawla, the owner  of the van did not file any appeal challenging the liability fastened  against him.  In the given facts and circumstances the appeal of the  New India Assurance Company Limited (MAC APP.66/2009)  deserves to be allowed. Ordered accordingly.   11. The liability fastened on the above said insurance company  (insurer of the van) by the Tribunal is set aside.   12. The appellant in MAC APP.66/2009 M/s. New India Assurance  Company Limited has already deposited 50% of the awarded amount  with the Tribunal which was invested and upon which interest has  been released to the claimant from time to time in terms of the earlier  orders. The amount lying with the Tribunal shall now be released to  the claimant forthwith. The appellant insurance company may take out  appropriate proceedings to recover it from the owner of the van.   13. The statutory amount, if made, shall also be refunded to the  appellant insurance company.   14. Both the appeals stand disposed of in above terms.       R.K.GAUBA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  vk  ",

JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA       JUDGMENT (ORAL)    1. On claim petition (MAC 61/2013) instituted by first and second  respondent jointly (claimants hereinafter) compensation in the sum of  Rs.6,29,368/- had been granted by the Motor Accident Claims  Tribunal (Tribunal) by judgment dated 06.12.2016 on account of death  of their child Rohit Kumar in an accident that occurred on 03.11.2012.   While awarding the compensation, the Tribunal has levied interest at  the rate of 12% p.a.  It is this liability which is the sole point of  grievance raised in the present appeal.  2. The claimants have appeared through counsel on notice and the  learned counsel fairly concedes that there were no special reasons why  a higher than the ordinarily levied rate of interest should have been  imposed.  Following the consistent view by this Court, the award is    MAC Appeal No. 261/2017      Page 2 of 2      modified.  The compensation directed to be paid by the Tribunal shall  be borne by the appellant / insurance company with interest at the rate  of 9% p.a. from the date of filing of the claim petition till realization.   [see judgment dated 22.02.2016 in MAC.APP. 165/2011 Oriental  Insurance Co Ltd v. Sangeeta Devi & Ors.].  3. The amount in terms of these directions shall be released from  the amount deposited by the insurance company, the excess being  refunded.  The statutory amount shall also be refunded.  4. The appeal and the pending application are disposed of  accordingly.      R.K.GAUBA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  yg             ",

Appellants      Through: Mr. S.N. Parashar, Advocate        versus     DINESH KUMAR & ORS       ..... Respondents  Through: Mr. Pankaj proxy counsel for Ms.  Shantha Devi Raman, Advocate for R-3  CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA       JUDGMENT (ORAL)    1. The appellants had claimed compensation in the wake of  detailed accident report (DAR) registered (D-93/16) in the Motor  Accident Claims Tribunal (Tribunal) on 30.11.2015 on account of  death of Rafique in a motor vehicular accident that occurred on  11.10.2015 in the area of police station Delhi Cantt, it statedly  involving negligent driving of motor vehicle no.DL-3CAG-5269 by  the first respondent.  It appears that the vehicle was owned by the  second respondent and insured against third party risk at the relevant  period with the third respondent.  2. The tribunal, after issuance of notice, held inquiry and on that  basis rendered judgment dated 27.10.2016 awarding compensation in  the total sum of Rs.20,34,243/- with interest at the rate of 9% p.a. to  be paid with effect from 30.11.2015, date of filing of the DAR till    MAC Appeal No. 535/17      Page 2 of 3      realization, the liability having been fastened against the insurer.  3. The appellants have come up before this court by the appeal at  hand raising only one grievance, it being that in calculation of loss of  dependency, the element of future prospects was not factored in.  4. It is noted that in the evidence led before the tribunal, it was  brought out that the deceased was 34 years old person, self-employed  having own business of garments.  But this was not substantiated by  any concrete evidence.  The tribunal noted that the deceased had  studied upto 8 th  standard and in absence of any formal proof assumed  his income on the basis of minimum wages of non-matriculates at  Rs.10140/- p.m.  It did not add the element of future prospects.  5. In the case reported as Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport  Corporation & Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121, Supreme Court, inter-alia,  ruled that the element of future prospects of increase in income will  not be granted in cases where the deceased was “self employed” or  was working on a “fixed salary”.  Though this view was affirmed by a  bench of three Hon’ble Judges in Reshma Kumari & Ors. Vs. Madan  Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 65, on account of divergence of views,  as arising from the ruling in Rajesh & Ors. vs. Rajbir & Ors., (2013) 9  SCC 54, the issue was later referred to a larger bench, inter-alia, by  order dated 02.07.2014 in National Insurance Company Ltd. vs.  Pushpa & Ors., (2015) 9 SCC 166.      6. Against the above backdrop, by judgment dated 22.01.2016  passed in MAC Appeal No. 956/2012 (Sunil Kumar v. Pyar Mohd.),  this Court has found it proper to follow the view taken earlier by a  learned single judge in MAC Appeal No. 189/2014 (HDFC Ergo    MAC Appeal No. 535/17      Page 3 of 3      General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Lalta Devi & Ors.)  decided on  12.1.2015, presently taking the decision in Reshma Kumari (Supra) as  the binding precedent, till such time the law on the subject of future  prospects for those who are “self-employed” or engaged in gainful  employment at a “fixed salary” is clarified by a larger bench of the  Supreme Court.     7. There is no clear evidence showing element of future prospects  of increase in income in the case at hand.  8. In above view, the appeal is found devoid of substance and is  dismissed.   The pending application also stands dismissed.          R.K.GAUBA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  yg             ",

The truck is stated to be owned by Satbir and Surender,  sons of Ram Sarup, who were brought before the Motor Accident  Claims Tribunal (Tribunal) as second respondents, it having been  driven at the relevant point of time by Ram Singh and being insured  against third party risk for the relevant period with Oriental Insurance  Company Limited, each of whom were impleaded as first and third  respondent respectively in the claim petitions, the said insurance    MAC Appeal No. 896/2016 Etc.     Page 3 of 8      company being now the appellant in MAC APP.896/2016, 902/2016  and 903/2016 (hereinafter as the insurer).   2. Three persons were travelling in the car including Rahul Yadav  and Nitin Yadav, 25 years and 23 years old persons, who died as a  result of the injuries suffered in the accident, another being Rajbir  Yadav, 26 years old, the latter suffering injuries in the process.   3. A police case was registered vide First Information Report  (FIR) No.91/2012 with the local police, in the wake of which a  Detailed Accident Report (DAR) came to be submitted.  In the wake  of DAR, three claim petitions came before the court, they being  MACP  case Nos.599/2012/2014, 600/2012/2014 and 601/2012/2014.   The first of the said claim petition was instituted by Rajbir Yadav for  compensation for injuries suffered by him, the other two having been  instituted by the legal heirs/dependents of the deceased Nitin Yadav  and Rahul Yadav respectively.   4. The Tribunal had inquiry by consolidating all the three cases.  Common evidence was led.  The claim petitions were decided by  common judgment rendered on 04.07.2016. In all the three cases, the  question of negligence was considered and, on the basis of the  evidence led, the Tribunal recorded finding that the collision took  place due to negligence on the part of the tractor driver.   5. For the injuries suffered by Rajbir Yadav on his claim petition  compensation of Rs.79,480/- was awarded.  In the case of claim on  account of death of Nitin Yadav, a bachelor, the claim having been    MAC Appeal No. 896/2016 Etc.     Page 4 of 8      presented by his parents and minor sister, compensation of  Rs.27,73,000/- was awarded while in the case of claim on account of  death of Rahul Yadav, it having been presented by his widow, minor  son and widowed mother, compensation of Rs.16,03,032/- was  awarded. In all the three cases, the Tribunal added the element of  interest @ 10% per annum from the date of filing of the petitions, i.e.,  10.07.2012, fastening the liability on the insurer.      6. The insurance company by its three appeals has questioned the  correctness of the finding recorded on the issue of negligence, its  contention being that Rahul Yadav, the driver of the car, had also  contributed to the cause of accident.  The insurance company also  assails the calculations of compensation in the two death cases and  takes exception to the levy of interest @ 10% per annum.   7. The claimants in the two death cases have also come up with  their respective appeals, the appeal on behalf of legal heirs of Rahul  Yadav being MAC APP.266/2017 and the appeal in case of death of  Nitin Yadav being MAC APP.271/2017, each claiming enhanced  compensation.   8. Arguments have been heard at length and the record has been  perused.   ON NEGLIGENCE  9. The submission of the insurer on the issue of negligence is  devoid of substance.  The evidence of Rajbir Yadav (PW-3), the  surviving passenger in the car itself is sufficient to nail the    MAC Appeal No. 896/2016 Etc.     Page 5 of 8      responsibility at the door of the tractor driver. The evidence, supported  by the corresponding police record, clearly shows that the tractor was  wrongly parked on the wrong side without any caution sign.  It was  primarily on this count that the car came to strike against it sometime  after midnight.  Neither the insurer nor the tractor owner or driver  made any attempt to bring any evidence to prove facts to the contrary.  The said finding, therefore, does not call for any interference.  COMPENSATION IN CASE OF DEATH OF RAHUL YADAV   10. Deceased Rahul Yadav was 25 years old and had completed  secondary school examination. As per the evidence of his wife (PW- 1), he had been in a private service as CCTV operator earning  Rs.9,000/- per month.  She sought to prove this fact on the basis of  salary certificate Ex.PW-1/8.  This, however, could not have been  accepted and was rightly rejected as no formal proof about such  engagement was brought in.  The evidence was also led by the  testimony of PW-4 to the effect that Rahul Yadav was son of a former  employee of Delhi Police who had died during service, Rahul Yadav’s  candidature for appointment on compassionate grounds having been  accepted and he being offered appointment but, subject to medical  fitness.  Before he could undergo medical examination or take up such  appointment, unfortunately, he died in the accident.  In these  circumstances, the Tribunal did not accept the plea of the claimants  that the earnings of Rahul Yadav on which loss of dependency had to  be worked out should be assumed on the basis of what would have    MAC Appeal No. 896/2016 Etc.     Page 6 of 8      been his income if he had joined service of Delhi Police. The Tribunal  instead went by minimum wages.   11. The claimants reiterate their arguments that the loss of  dependency had to be worked out assuming the salary that Rahul  Yadav would have drawn if he had joined the police services.   12. Having accorded serious consideration to the above aspect, this  court is unable to accept the contention of the claimants. It is the  actual loss of dependency which has to be compensated.  The future  income on the basis of such candidature or aspiration for government  service as mentioned above is in the realm of speculation.  It was  contingent upon further test as to fitness to be undergone. Therefore,  such income cannot be treated as the income of which there has been a  loss. The approach of the Tribunal in this regard cannot be faulted.   13. In above view, the compensation awarded by the Tribunal does  not call for any modification.   COMPENSATION IN CASE OF DEATH OF NITIN YADAV   14. The deceased Nitin Yadav was a bachelor, the claim having  been brought by his parents and minor sister.  The minor sister is  primarily dependant on her father. It cannot at the same time be denied  that she would have also looked upto her elder brother for some  sustenance. But this does not mean the choice of multiplier had to be  on the basis of the age of the deceased. The prime dependents whose  loss requires to be compensated being the parents, the multiplier  should have been chosen on the basis of the age of the mother. She    MAC Appeal No. 896/2016 Etc.     Page 7 of 8      being 49 years old at the relevant point of time, the multiplier of 18  adopted for calculation will have to be suitably amended. Thus, loss of  dependency is to be worked out on the multiplier of 13.  15. The Tribunal found on the basis of evidence the monthly salary  of the deceased to be Rs.17,000/-. Deducting one-third towards  personal and living expenses, the loss of dependency comes to  (17,000/- x 2 ÷ 3 x 12 x 13) Rs.17,67,999.99 rounded off to  Rs.17,68,000/-.  16. This court agrees with the submission of the insurer that in case  of a bachelor the addition of Rs.1,00,000/- under the head of loss of  consortium was uncalled for.  The said award will have to be vacated.  17. Thus, the total compensation in the case of death of Nitin Yadav  works out to (17,68,000/- + 25,000/- + 1,00,000/- + 1,00,000/-)  Rs.19,93,000/-.   18. The compensation in the case of death of Nitin Yadav is  modified accordingly.     INTEREST  19. Following the consistent view taken by this Court [see judgment  dated 22.02.2016 in MAC.APP. 165/2011 Oriental Insurance Co Ltd  v. Sangeeta Devi & Ors.], the rate of interest levied in all the three  cases is reduced to 9% per annum from the date of filing of the  respective petitions.      MAC Appeal No. 896/2016 Etc.     Page 8 of 8      DIRECTIONS  20. In the three appeals filed by the insurance company, by similar  orders passed on 26.10.2016, it was directed that the insurance  company would pay 50% of the awarded amount with upto date  interest @ 9% per annum with UCO Bank, Delhi High Court Branch  and upon such deposit being made the amounts were to be kept in  fixed deposits. The Registrar General shall take necessary steps to  ensure that the said amounts kept in fixed deposits are released to the  respective claimants.   21. The insurance company is directed to deposit the balance  amounts in terms of the above directions in each case with the  Tribunal within thirty days of today.   22. The statutory deposits, if made, shall also be released to the  insurance company.   23. All the five appeals stand disposed of with these directions.          R.K.GAUBA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  vk  ",

Petitioner      Through Mr. Sachin Chauhan, Advocate.        versus     MINISTRY OF RAILWAY, GOVT.OF INDIA&ORS. Respondents  Through Mr. J.K. Singh, Standing Counsel & Ms.  Madhulika Agarwal, Advocate.     CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE NAVIN CHAWLA    SANJIV KHANNA, J. (ORAL):    The petitioner was appointed as Constable (General Duty) in the  Railway Protection Force.  Subsequently, the petitioner was discharged on  account of his involvement in FIR No. 62/2012 dated 25 th  April, 2012  under Section 323/324//506/148/149 IPC registered at Police Station  Julana, Haryana.    2. The petitioner had duly mentioned the aforesaid FIR in his  attestation form on 18 th  May, 2014.  Thus, this is not a case of  concealment.    3. The petitioner had earlier filed Writ Petition (C) No. 748/2016  challenging the order of discharge.  He had also relied upon judgment of  acquittal dated 1 st  December, 2015 passed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate    W.P. (C) No. 3906/2016                                                                                                         Page 2 of 3    in CIS No. 39586/2013 titled State versus Mahender and Others.  This  writ petition was disposed of vide order dated 24 th  February, 2016 with a  direction to the respondents to consider the petitioner’s representation in  the light of the said judgment and affidavit dated 8 th  February, 2016.  The  respondents were asked to pass a speaking order in accordance with law  under intimation to the petitioner.  Certain other directions were also  issued.    4. The respondents vide order dated 11 th  April, 2016 have rejected the  representation made by the petitioner recording that the petitioner was  acquitted vide judgment dated 1 st  December, 2015 whereas the discharge  order was passed earlier on 17 th  September, 2015.  It has been observed  that the petitioner was under trial on the date of issue of discharge order.    5. We do not think that the impugned order dated 11 th  April, 2016 can  be sustained in view of the subsequent pronouncement of the Supreme  Court vide judgment dated 21 st  July, 2016 in Avtar Singh versus Union of  India and Others, (2016) 8 SCC 471.  The respondents would have to re- examine the entire case afresh in the light of the observations and the ratio  pronounced by the Supreme Court.  The said exercise will be undertaken  by the respondents within a period of six weeks from the date a copy of  this order is received.  It will be open to the petitioner to make a further  representation highlighting the relevant paragraphs/sub-paras of the  judgment on which he relies with reference to the criminal case in    W.P. (C) No. 3906/2016                                                                                                         Page 3 of 3    question.  We hope and trust that the respondent authorities will give due  consideration and notice the observations and ratio of the Supreme Court  and the parameters/criteria prescribed therein.  The respondents would pass  a speaking order dealing with the contentions raised and the  criteria/parameters prescribed by the Supreme Court.  In case the  respondents accept the petitioner’s representation, the petitioner would be  entitled to continuity of service and other benefits as may have accrued to  him in terms of the directions already issued in the order dated 24 th   February, 2016.  Needless to state that in case of an adverse order, the  petitioner would be entitled to challenge the same in accordance with law.     The writ petition is disposed of, with no order as to costs.                SANJIV KHANNA, J.              NAVIN CHAWLA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  VKR/NA  ",

CAS.12/1990 & 16/1998   Page 2 of 10        In the above-captioned first petition, probate of Will dated 31 st   August, 1971 is sought by wife of late Banarsi Dass, who claims to be  the Executor of the said Will. Copy of the Will dated 31 st  August, 1971 is  annexed as Annexure-B with the probate petition and the particulars of  immovable property i.e. B-1/20, Hauz Khas, New Delhi are attached as  Schedule ‘B’ to the probate petition. List of legal heirs of late Banarsi  Dass is Schedule ‘A’ to this petition. Particulars of cash deposit made by  late Banarsi Dass with M/s. Prithvi Raj Banarsi Dass and M/s. Prithvi  Raj Banarsi Dass Saree House are appended as Schedule ‘C’ to this  petition. List of liabilities of late Banarsi Dass are Schedule ‘D’ to this  petition. Copy of death certificate of late Banarsi Dass is Annexure-A to  this petition. Copy of the assessment order in respect of immovable  property in question is Annexure-C to this petition.   The undisputed facts are that late Banarsi Dass was owner of  immovable property B-1/20, Hauz Khas, New Delhi and he had died on  29 th  December, 1984 and that late Banarsi Dass had left behind his  widow-Smt. Krishna and four daughters whose particulars find mention  in Schedule ‘A’ to the probate petition. It is also not in dispute that late  Banarsi Dass, during his lifetime, had remarried after the death of his  first wife and Smt. Janak Rani, Usha and Veena are his daughters from  his first wife and Smt. Neeru Babbar is the daughter from his second  wife.   It is also matter of record that during the pendency of these  petitions, Smt. Krishna (wife of late Banarsi Dass) and Ms. Usha  (daughter of late Banarsi Dass) had died and Ms. Neeru Babbar, legal    TEST. CAS.12/1990 & 16/1998   Page 3 of 10       heir of Smt. Krishna, has been brought on record. In the above-captioned  first petition, probate is sought in respect of Will of 31 st  August, 1971  whereas in the above-captioned second petition, Letter of Administration  is sought on the basis of Will of 20 th  November, 1984 in respect of  tenancy rights in house No. 3500, Gali Sang-Tarashan, Bara Hindu Rao,  Delhi having good-will/pugree of Rupees Five lacs. Apart from the  immovable property as detailed in Annexure ‘B’ to the petition filed by  Smt. Janak Rani and others, Goodwill in the partnership business of late  Banarsi Dass is also sought.    On 30 th  November, 1995, the following issues were framed in the  above-captioned first petition: -  “1. Whether the deceased Late Sh. Banarsi Das executed  will dated 31.08.1971 and the same is the last will of the  deceased?  OPP.  2. Whether the deceased executed will dated 20.11.1984  as his last will bequeathing all his properties to the  petitioners and respondents in equal shares? OPD.  3. Whether the petitioner is entitled to the grant of  probate in respect of will dated 31.08.1971.”     The order of 17 th  October, 2006 in the above-captioned second  petition reveals that the issues framed in the above-captioned first petition  have been treated as issues framed in the above-captioned second petition  as well. The evidence recorded in the above-captioned first petition  comprises of deposition of Ms. Neeru Babbar (PW2), Naveen Gulati  (PW-3), Ajay Chawla (PW-4), who are the sons of the attesting witnesses  as both the attesting witnesses had died before the commencement of    TEST. CAS.12/1990 & 16/1998   Page 4 of 10       recording of evidence. Sh. D.R.Handa, Senior Scientific Officer from  CFSL has been also got examined as PW-4, who had deposed in respect  of both the Wills in question. In the above-captioned first petition, Ms.  Janak Rani has deposed as DW-1 to contest the Will dated 31 st  August,  1971 and has also set up the Will of 20 th  November, 1984 to equally  divide the immovable property between the parties.    In the above-captioned second petition, Ms. Janak Rani has again  deposed as PW-1 and has got examined her real sister Ms. Veena as PW- 2. Apart from this, Ms. Janak Rani has also got examined T.R. Nayyar  (PW-3), who claims to be the eye-witness to the Will of 20 th  November,  1984. PW-4 is a private handwriting expert, who has been got examined  by Ms. Janak Rani in her petition. Pertinently, Ms. Neeru Babbar, the  legal heir of Smt. Krishna, has not stepped into the witness box in the  above-captioned second petition. In the above-captioned second petition,  vide order of 23 rd  March, 1999, it was directed that this petition has to be  heard alongwith above-captioned first petition. So, these two petitions  have been heard together and are being decided by this common  judgment while clarifying that the evidence recorded in the above- captioned second petition would not be transposed in the above-captioned  first petition or vice versa.    It is matter of record that Will of 20 th  November, 1984 has been set  up in the written statement filed in the above-captioned first petition,  therefore, issue No.2 framed in the above-captioned first petition relates  to the Will set up in the above-captioned second petition.   Learned counsel for Smt. Krishna (whose now being represented    TEST. CAS.12/1990 & 16/1998   Page 5 of 10       by her legal heir-Ms. Neera Babbar) submits that Will of 31 st  August,  1971 is a registered Will and its formal proof has been dispensed with  vide order of 27 th  November, 2000 and though the witness from  concerned Registrar’s office was present, he was discharged and the order  of 27 th  November, 2000 has attained finality.     Learned counsel for Smt. Krishna further submits that there is no  effective cross-examination of Ajay Chawla, Naveen Gulati and even  Smt. Neeru Babbar regarding the Will of 31 st  August, 1971 and in view of  evidence of CFSL expert (PW-4), the Will of 31 st  August, 1971 ought to  be probated.   At this stage, it is pointed out by counsel opposite that Naveen  Gulati (PW-3) in his cross-examination has denied the suggestion in  respect of both the Wills in the following manner:-   “It is incorrect to suggest that will Ex  P-1 and Ex PW- 1/BC both bears signatures of my father as an attesting  witness No.1.”     Undisputedly, Sh. R.R. Gulati (who is no longer in this world) was  a witness to the Will of 31 st  August, 1971 (Ex.P-1) and the subsequent  Will of 20 th  November, 1984 (Ex.P1/C).  It is next submitted by learned counsel for Smt. Krishna that the  FSL report (Ex.PW4/A) clinches the issue as the CFSL expert has  categorically stated in his report that the signatures of late Banarsi Dass  on the Will of 20 th  November, 1984 do not tally with his admitted  signatures and the reasons for this opinion are spelt out in this report,  which have not been negated in the cross-examination of this expert.     TEST. CAS.12/1990 & 16/1998   Page 6 of 10        It is also pointed out that even the signatures of attesting witness- R.R. Gulati on the questioned Will of 20 th  November, 1984 do not tally  with his admitted signatures. Lastly, it is submitted that Ms. Janak Rani  in her cross-examination has admitted that the Will of 31 st  August, 1971  (Ex. P-1) bears the signatures of late Banarsi Dass and attesting witness- R.R. Gulati and Sh.B.K. Chawla and so, the Will (Ex.P-1) stands duly  proved. Thus, it is submitted that Will of 31 st  August, 1971 ought to be  probated and the subsequent Will of 20 th  November, 1984 deserves to be  rejected.   On the other hand, learned counsel for Ms. Janak Rani submits that  the Will (Ex.P-1) is vague as it does not describe the property bequeathed  and is utterly vague and so, it needs to be discarded as it cannot be  executed. To submit so, reliance is placed upon Supreme Court’s decision  in Anil Kak v. Kumari Sharada Raje and Ors., AIR 2008 SC 2195.   It is pointed out by learned counsel for Janak Rani that as per  Section 281 of Indian Succession Act, the petition is required to be  verified by one of the attesting witnesses and since the son of B.K.  Chawla has not deposed about the verification of the probate petition,  therefore, the probate petition is rendered invalid. It is also submitted that  the son of attesting witnesses have not duly identified the signatures of  attesting witnesses on the Will (Ex.P-1) and so, it cannot be said that the  said Will stands duly proved.",

JUSTICE SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL        O R D E R   %   05.07.2017  CRL.M.A. 8377/2017 (exemption)   Allowed, subject to all just exceptions.     Application stands disposed of.  CRL.M.C. 2039/2017  1. Notice. Mr. Abhay Kumar accepts notice for the Respondent.  2. The present petition has been filed under Section 482 of the Code  of Criminal Procedure for setting aside of order dated 22.03.2017 passed  by Sh. Sanjay Kumar Aggarwal, ASJ (Electricity) North West District,  Rohini, Delhi.  3. The factual matrix of the present petition is that three inspections  were carried on 19.06.2010, 23.06.2010 and 02.07.2010 at G-118, Sector- 2, DSIDC Bawana, Delhi with respect to electricity connection. On the  basis of the inspections the respondent passed an assessment order dated  14.12.2011 stating that the case falls in the category of theft of electricity.    CRL.M.C. 2039/2017        Page 2 of 4    The respondent filed a complaint against the petitioners alleging  dishonest abstraction of energy by tampering the meter.   4. Learned ASJ vide order dated 22.03.2017  accepted the contention  of the respondent and framed the charges against the petitioners U/s 135  of the Indian Electricity Act, 2003 r/w 34 of the Indian Penal Code. The  relevant portion of the order dated 22.03.2017 under challenge is  reproduced as under:   “… The record makes it clear that there is prima  facie evidence that accused no. 2 & 3 were the users  of the electricity at the given site and there is also  prima facie evidence that the meter was tampered  with for illegal abstraction of energy. More so, it is  settled law that at the time of framing charge grave  suspicion is enough for making a prima facie case.    xxxxx  Accordingly, prima facie case u/s 135 of the Indian  Electricity Act, 2003 read with Section 34 of the  Indian Penal Code is made out against accused  Praveen Kumar Jain and Jaideep Jain.   Bail bonds of accused Dheeraj Gupta stands  cancelled. Surety discharged.”    5. Adversely affected by aforesaid order, the petitioner filed the  present petition for quashing of order dated 22.03.2017.  6. Mr. Fanish K. Jain, counsel for the petitioner submitted that the  learned ASJ failed to consider the inspection report, testimony of the  witness in pre-summoning evidence and the entire material on record in  the right perspective. He further submitted that inspections dated  19.06.2010 and 23.06.2010 clearly depict that there was no physical  tampering of any kind in the meter rather the same was found to be intact.  7. It was further urged that from the three consecutive inspection it is  clear that the consumer cannot be made responsible for the alleged    CRL.M.C. 2039/2017        Page 3 of 4    discrepancy if any found in the CT wires or CT/PT terminal block pins  and it is not possible for the consumer to have access to the said CT wires  to cut and rejoin them and to replace CT/PT pins in the terminal block  and thus no case of theft of electricity is made out.  8. Counsel for the petitioner further submitted that the inspection  report dated 02.07.2010 cannot be admissible and in terms of Regulation  52(viii) of Delhi Electricity Supply Code and Performance Standard  Regulation, 2007, the respondent was under an obligation to get the meter  tested in DERC notified NABL accredited laboratory.  9. Contrarily, Mr. Abhay Kumar counsel for the respondent  contended that at this stage of framing of charge there is prima facie  evidence to show that the meter was tampered with by the petitioners. He  further submitted that the complex meters contain high technology and  tampering has been done in such a manner that even the specialist had  difficulty in detecting the tampering.   10. I have heard both the counsel for the parties and have also perused  the material available on record.  11. As the counsel for the petitioner contended that as per the  inspection reports dated 19.06.2010 and 23.06.2010, all the seals of the  meter, meter box and meter terminals were found intact and the  respondent in order to make a false case of theft of electricity conducted a  third inspection dated 02.07.2010 making allegations contrary to their  earlier inspection reports, the inspection report on 02.07.2010 is reiterated  below:  “Resin cast found damaged, repaired with M.Seal and  re-painted. C. T. wires of all phases found in cut and    CRL.M.C. 2039/2017        Page 4 of 4    re- joined position. In terminal block, the CT/PT pins  found replaced and refixed.   Paper seal vide no. 125490 &125491 dated  02.07.2010 duly signed by joint team pasted on meter  box.   Necessary photographs are taken by Mr. Rakesh of  M/s Prakash Studio.  Establishment type- Industrial.  Total connected load- 122.126 KW (As per previous  report).”  12. Since the petitioner has approached this court against the order of  charge, at this stage, I deem it appropriate to mention the law pertaining  to framing of charges. In State of M.P. v. Mohanlal Soni: 2000 Cri.LJ  3504 the Apex Court  held:  “8. The crystallized judicial view is that at the stage  of framing charge, the court has to prima facie  consider whether there is sufficient ground for  proceeding against the accused. The court is not  required to appreciate evidence to conclude whether  the materials produced are sufficient or not for  convicting the accused.”  13. Coming to the facts of this case, looking into the material and  documents that were made available at the stage of framing charge on  their face value and bearing in mind the settled position of law, there are  no valid grounds to interfere with the order of charge.   14. Consequently, the petition stands dismissed.  CRL.M.A. 8376/2017  In view of the above order, this application is rendered infructuous.        SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL, J.  JULY 05, 2017gr//  ",

Ojha, Advocate.  versus   STATE       ....Respondent  Through:   Mr. Ashok Kumar Garg, APP for the State.      CORAM:   HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE SANGITA DHINGRA SEHGAL        O R D E R   %   05.07.2017  1. By this present application filed under Section 389(1) of Cr. P.C.,  the applicant, inter-alia seeking grant of interim bail in FIR No. 314/2006  under Sections 307/186/353/34 of the Indian Penal Code registered at  Police Station Hazrat Nizamuddin, Delhi. The applicant is stated to be in  custody for more than 2 years and 4 months.  2. Mr. L. Ojha, learned counsel for the applicant contended that the  conviction of the appellant has caused great psychological breakdown of  his wife. Dr. Naresh Kumar, MD of Yashraj Hospital at Sikandrabad,  U.P, has advised mental support and care for her. He further contended  that the applicant's two small daughters, one in nursery and one in the          1 st  standard, need care and affection at this stage, which the wife of the  applicant is unable to render due to her poor health conditions. Therefore,  interim bail must be granted to the applicant in light of the aforesaid  circumstances.  3. On the converse, Mr. Ashok Kumar Garg, Addl. Public Prosecutor    Crl.M.(Bail) No. 1072/2017 in CRL.A. 721/2016    Page 2 of 4    appearing for the State relied upon the Status Report filed by the Crime  Branch in the case and contended that the applicant has also preferred a  regular bail application on the same grounds, which is already pending  adjudication before this Court and thus, this application must be rejected  at this stage.  4.   The submissions of learned counsel appearing on behalf of the  applicant as well as the submissions of learned Additional Public  Prosecutor have been heard and the Status Report placed on record has  also been perused.  5. The Status Report filed by the respondent states as under:-  \"That, the petitioner has filed this fresh Crl. M (Bail)  application in Crl. Appeal No. 721/16 for seeking  temporary suspension of sentence and grant of  interim bail U/s 389 (1) of Cr.P.C. Vide this  application, the applicant claimed the ground for  relief as psychological break down of his wife, for  which a regular bail has already been sought. The  petitioner also annexed certain documents/medical  papers issued by Dr. Naresh Kumar, MD, Yashraj  Hospital, Sikandrabad, UP. For the same, enquiry  has been made from the doctor concerned. It has been  reported by the doctor concerned of Yashraj Hospital,  Sikandrabad, UP that Mrs. Renu W/o Raj Kumar is  suffering from Psychosis/mental disorder/depression  since last one year and needs support. The doctor  further mentioned that the patient was asked to take  opinion in IBHAAS and other Psychiatrist. Copy of  the certificate dated 30.06.2017 issued by the doctor  concerned is enclosed as Annexure\"A\". However, no  such openion has been ever obtained from IBHAS or  any Psychiatrist. Except of dated 14.04.2017 &  18.05.2017, no other medical prescription papers or  clinical reports were ever provided by the petitioner's  family to prove that Ms. Renu is under treatment for    Crl.M.(Bail) No. 1072/2017 in CRL.A. 721/2016    Page 3 of 4    last one year. This clearly indicates some other  storey. During enquiry, it was also revealed that Renu  is Pradhan (Sarpanch) of village Mahiya Jagir,  Sikandrabad U.P. As to how, it is possible to perform  the responsibilities of a Pradhan (Sarpanch), if she is  suffering from such acute disorder. Further, the  petitioner is having 3 brothers, who with family are  also residing at the same village. They can look after  the wife of the petitioner during her treatment.   That it is also pertinent to mention here that the  petitioner is a hardcore criminal and is involved in 3  other criminal cases which 1) case FIR No. 195/05 u/s  302/341 IPC PS Sikandra Bad, UP, 2) case FIR No.  273/05 u/s 302 IPC PS Sikandra Bad, UP & 3) case  FIR No. 403/06 u/s 2/3 Gangster Act. PS Sikandra  Bad, UP. Copy of the involvements chart is annexed  as Annexure \"B\". In view the antecedents of the  petitioner, there is a grave apprehension that he may  jump the conditions, if granted any relief.\"  6. The Status Report has revealed that the wife of the applicant i.e.       Mrs. Renu is also the Sarpanch of the village Mahiya Jagir, Sikandrabad,  U.P. During the course of arguments, it was not denied by the learned  counsel for the applicant that the wife of applicant is the Sarpanch of the  village. It was rather clarified by him that the wife of the applicant is the  Pradhan of the village. Therefore, it is difficult to fathom that Mrs. Renu  being so unwell mentally on one hand, is carrying out her responsibilities  as the Pradhan of the village. Furthermore, she was directed to take an  opinion from Institute of Human Behaviour & Allied Sciences (IBHAAS)  and admittedly, no such opinion has ever been obtained.  7. Attention of this Court has also been drawn towards the fact that  the applicant has three brothers, who are residing in the same village with  their families and in case of need, there are enough members of the    Crl.M.(Bail) No. 1072/2017 in CRL.A. 721/2016    Page 4 of 4    family to help and support  the wife and daughters of the applicant.   8. Moreover, in Para 7 of the present application, it has been stated by  the applicant as under:-  \"7. That the next date of hearing is 21.08.2017 and  the medical advice by the doctor treating the wife of  the applicant is for mental support and care....\"  9. Admittedly, the only advice given by the doctor as per their own  application is for mental support and care of the wife of the applicant.  Therefore, this alone cannot be a ground for grant of interim bail in the  present case.   10. Therefore, this Court is not inclined to grant interim bail to the  applicant in light of the facts and circumstances of this case. Resultantly,  in the considered opinion of this Court, the present interim bail  application filed by the applicant is dismissed.

This Rent Control Revision Petition under Section 25-B of the  Delhi Rent Control Act, 1958 impugns the order dated 16 th  November,  2016 of the Additional Rent Controller of dismissal of application filed  by the petitioner / tenant for leave to defend the petition for eviction filed  by the respondent / landlord for eviction of the petitioner / tenant from  Shop No.1492 on ground floor forming part of property no.1483 – 1492,  Ward No.XIV, Gali Chuleh Wali, Sadar Nala Road, Pan Mandi, Sadar  Bazar, Delhi – 110006 and consequently passing an order of eviction of  the petitioner / tenant.  2. This petition was entertained and notice thereof issued to the  respondent. Vide subsequent, also ex parte order dated 29 th  May, 2017,  operation of the impugned order was stayed.   3. The counsel for the respondent / landlord appears.   4. The counsel for the petitioner / tenant has been heard at length.  5. The learned Additional Rent Controller in a lucid and well  reasoned order has held (i) that there is no merit in the denial by the    RC.REV. No.201/2017                                                                                                     Page 2 of 9    petitioner / tenant in the application for leave to defend of being in  possession of the shop in question owing to having a lien thereon under a  building contract, because of admission of the petitioner of being a  tenant under the respondent / landlord in an affidavit filed in another  litigation and that owing to the said affidavit filed by the petitioner /  tenant he was estopped from denying the relationship of landlord and  tenant between himself and the respondent / landlord; (ii) that there is no  merit in the plea of the petitioner / tenant in the application for leave to  defend of the respondent / landlord being not entitled to maintain the  petition for eviction for the reason of being a co-owner thereof and for  the reason of non-impleadment of his brother alleged to be the other co- owner as party to the eviction proceedings because the respondent /  landlord as a co-owner was entitled to maintain a petition for eviction  especially in view of admission by the petitioner / tenant of the  relationship of landlord and tenant with the respondent / landlord; (iii)  that though the property no. 1483 – 1492, Ward No.XIV, Gali Chuleh  Wali, Sadar Nala Road, Pan Mandi, Sadar Bazar, Delhi in a portion  whereof the petitioner is a tenant comprises of a number of other shops  as well (22 according to the respondent / landlord and 26 according to  the petitioner / tenant) but the respondent / landlord had sufficiently  explained in the petition for eviction as to which shop or which portion is  being used by which other tenant or a family member of the respondent /  landlord; the petitioner / tenant on the other hand had made vague  averments, without filing any site plan, to contradict the site plan filed by  the respondent / landlord; (iv) that similarly there is no merit in the plea  of the petitioner / tenant in the application for leave to defend of the     RC.REV. No.201/2017                                                                                                     Page 3 of 9    three sons out of the ten sons of the respondent / landlord on the ground  of whose requirement the petition for eviction was filed being gainfully  employed elsewhere as the petitioner / tenant had failed to state as to  what business or profession or vocation the said three sons of the  respondent / landlord were carrying or from where were they carrying on  commercial activities; (v) that though according to the respondent /  landlord the aforesaid three sons were residing with him; according to  the petitioner / tenant they were residing separately; even if it was to be  held that the said three sons of the respondent / landlord  were residing  separately, in the absence of any alternative suitable space pleaded for  them to carry on their commercial activities, the respondent / landlord  could always seek eviction of the petitioner / tenant for the need of his  sons who were dependent upon him for accommodation; moreover the  petitioner / tenant had not stated from where were the said three sons  carrying on their profession or business or what profession or business;  (vi) that vague averments without any substance could not form the basis  for grant of leave to defend; (vii) that thus there was nothing to  contradict that the three sons, pleading whose requirement the  respondent / landlord had filed the petition for eviction, were not  unemployed or were not in requirement of the shop for carrying on their  own commercial activities; (viii) in the absence of plea of any alternative  space available to the said three sons of the respondent / landlord, they  were dependent upon their father for their need for commercial space;  (ix) that though as per the Sale Deed of the property in question the  respondent / landlord along with his brother Abdul Majid were the  owners but the respondent / landlord had proved that in a suit for    RC.REV. No.201/2017                                                                                                     Page 4 of 9    partition, a compromise was arrived at and the respondent / landlord was  the landlord of the premises in question; and, (x) that no objection had  been filed by the brother of the respondent / landlord namely Abdul  Majid to the respondent / landlord filing the petition for eviction against  the petitioner / tenant and for this reason also the respondent / landlord  was entitled to maintain the petition for eviction.  6. The counsel for the petitioner / tenant has concentrated his  arguments on the ground of the respondent / landlord being not entitled  to maintain the petition for eviction without impleading his brother  Abdul Majid as a party thereto. The counsel for the petitioner / tenant  has contended that the principle of a co-owner being entitled to maintain  a petition for eviction of a tenant on the ground of bona fide requirement  would not be available in the present case owing to the suit for partition  between the respondent / landlord and his brother Abdul Majid still  pending consideration. The counsel for the petitioner / tenant without  naming the judgment has argued that there is a judgment of the Supreme  Court that when there is a dispute between the co-owners, one of the co- owners cannot maintain a petition for eviction.   7. However the counsel for the petitioner / tenant is unable to show  anything on record from which it can be inferred that any such suit for  partition between the respondent / landlord and his brother Abdul Majid  is still pending consideration. All that he states is that now that notice of  the petition has been issued and the counsel for the respondent / landlord  is before this Court, he should be asked.    RC.REV. No.201/2017                                                                                                     Page 5 of 9    8. The counsel for the respondent / landlord on enquiry states that  though a suit is pending before this Court but by an interim order of  Justice G. S. Sistani therein the respondent / landlord was granted liberty  to file the petition for eviction against the tenants.  9. I have reminded the counsel for the petitioner / tenant of the  judgment of the Supreme Court in Surayya Begum Vs. Mohd. Usman  (1991) 3 SCC 114 and he confirms that he was referring to the same  judgment.   10. Supreme Court in Surayya Begum was concerned not with a case  of co-owners but with a case of petition for eviction after death of  original tenant, impleading only some of the heirs of original tenant as  party thereto. The question for adjudication was, whether the order of  eviction was non-executable for non-impleadment of some of the heirs  of original tenant. It was held that the principle of representation of  interest of a person, not impleaded by name in a judicial proceeding,  through a named party, is well known; however the same is subject to  essential condition that the interest of a person concerned has really been  represented by the others – his interest has been looked after in a bona  fide manner; if there be any clash of interest between the person  concerned and his assumed representative, or if the latter due to  collusion or for any other reason mala fide neglects to defend the case,  he cannot be considered to be a representative.      11. Even if the said principle is to be applied, the same would not  make the subject petition for eviction by the respondent / landlord alone,  without impleading his brother, non-maintainable.

LTD.    ..... Appellant  Through: Mr. Priyadarsi Acharya, Adv.         versus   RATTAN SINGH & ORS.      ..... Respondents  Through: None.       CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA       JUDGMENT (ORAL)    1. By judgment dated 19.02.2011, on the file of accident claim  case (Suit No. 744/2010/1999) instituted by first and second  respondents (collectively the claimants), the motor accident claims  tribunal (tribunal) awarded compensation in the sum of Rs. 2,07,125/-  with interest on account of death of Premwati in motor vehicular  accident that occurred on 31.12.1998 involving negligent driving of  truck bearing No DL 1GA 2101 (the truck) holding, amongst others,   the appellant- insurance company (insurer) liable calling it upon to  pay.  2. The insurance company has come up in appeal raising grievance  that the insurance policy against third party risk had been issued by it  in favour of Jasbir Singh, the then owner of the truck, he having been    MAC Appeal No. 1110/2012      Page 2 of 4      impleaded before the tribunal as first respondent but on his request, he  having been deleted from the array by order dated 08.07.2008, in view  of the fact that truck had been sold by him prior to the accident in  favour of one Amrik Singh (third respondent herein), the vehicle  having been driven by Bhupinder Singh (the first respondent herein)  he also having been added to the fray by subsequent amendment to the  claim petition.  The prime contention of the appellant insurance  company is that the vehicle having been sold off by the insured, he  (the owner) not being a party to the claim proceedings, it had no  liability to indemnify.  3. Inspite of due service, the respondents have failed to appear.  4. Arguments have been heard, the record perused.  It is clear from  the tribunal’s record that the person insured i.e. Jasbir Singh, son of  Rajinder Singh was deleted from the array by order dated 08.07.2008.  While it is true that the tribunal while rendering the judgment on  19.02.2011 was under the impression that Jasbir Singh, the insured,  had been deleted from the array, which fact is mentioned not only in  the cause title but also in (para 3 of) the impugned judgment, a perusal  of the tribunal’s record shows that there was no such order deleting  Jasbir Singh from the fray.  It does appear that Jasbir Singh in his  written statement had taken the position that he had transferred the  vehicle in favour of Amrik Singh on 14.12.1998 by sale and,  therefore, he was not liable with regard to the accident that had  occurred on 31.12.1998.  Amrik Singh who had been impleaded as  third respondent, in his written statement admitted having purchased  the vehicle from Jasbir Singh, he pegging the said transaction to    MAC Appeal No. 1110/2012      Page 3 of 4      11.10.1998 though confirming that the vehicle stood transferred in his  name on 14.12.1998.  If it were so, Jasbir Singh was neither the owner  nor responsible for the use of the vehicle on the date of the accident.    5. Thus, notwithstanding the fact that there is no formal order  deleting Jasbir Singh from the array of parties, there being no liability  in his respect, the insurance company which had issued the third party  insurance risk also cannot be called upon to indemnify.  In this regard,  reference needs to be made, inter alia,  to Section 157 of the Motor  Vehicles Act, 1988.  After having purchased the vehicle, Amrik Singh  is not shown to have taken any steps to have the policy transferred in  his name.    6. Thus, the appeal of the New India Assurance Company Ltd. is  allowed.  The directions in the impugned judgment fastening the  liability on it to pay compensation awarded in favour of the claimants  are set aside.  7. By order dated 15.10.2012, the insurance company had been  directed to deposit the awarded amount with UCO Bank, Delhi High  Court Branch in the name of the claimants, such amount to be kept in  fixed deposit receipt.  By order dated 11.09.2013, 80% of the said  amount with proportionate interest was allowed to be released to the  claimants.    8. The balance lying in fixed deposit receipt shall be refunded to  the New India Assurance Company Ltd. (appellant) forthwith. It will  be entitled to recover the amount paid in terms of the interim orders of  this Court (in appeal) from Amrik Singh or Bhupinder Singh (third    MAC Appeal No. 1110/2012      Page 4 of 4      and fourth respondents herein), by appropriate proceedings to be taken  out before the tribunal.   9. Statutory deposit, if deposited, shall be refunded.      R.K.GAUBA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  nk             ",

JUSTICE DEEPA SHARMA     O R D E R  %   05.07.2017    Caveat No. 598/2017   Since the caveator has put in appearance, the caveat stands  discharged.   W.P.(C) 5509/2017  1. The petitioner is aggrieved by order dated 29.05.2017 passed  by the learned Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal (DRAT) in  Miscellaneous Appeal No.192/2015 filed against an order dated  13.05.2015 passed by Debt Recovery Tribunal-II, Delhi (DRT-II) on  an application filed by the respondent No.2 (defendant No.1 before  DRT-II).   2. By the impugned order, the learned DRAT has directed the  petitioner to deposit a sum of Rs.1.38 crores with the Tribunal as a   W.P.(C) 5509/2017       Page 1 of 4      pre-condition to hear its appeal. Pursuant to passing of the said order,  the petitioner had filed an application for review of the order dated  29.05.2017, which was rejected by the DRAT on 28.06.2017.   3. Learned counsel for the petitioner states that the provisions of  Section 21 of Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and Financial  Institutions Act, 1993 which mandates deposit of the amount of debt  due at the time when the appeal is preferred by any person, do not  apply to the petitioner. He states that the debt due to the respondent  No.1-Bank is payable by the respondent No.2/company and in any  case, so far, the said amount has not been determined by the Debt  Recovery Tribunal as a “debt due” as has been contemplated under  Section 19 of the said Act.   4. Learned counsel for respondent No.1/Bank, who appears on  caveat, clarifies that the impugned order came to be passed by the  DRT-II only to test the bona fides of the petitioner who is a  consenting party to the said order, whereunder a miscellaneous  application filed by the respondent No.2 for seeking permission to  redeem a parcel of land situated in Village Pathreri, Near Bilaspur  Chowk, Tehsil Manesar, District Gurgaon (Haryana) was allowed and  with the consent of all the parties, the said parcel of land was agreed  to be sold to the respondent No.8, the purchaser, for a sum of Rs.1.38  crores. He states that pursuant to the aforesaid order, the respondent  No.8 has paid a sum of Rs.1.38 crores to the respondent No.1/Bank  and a Sale Certificate has been issued by the Bank. The Sale  Certificate has yet to be registered though the   W.P.(C) 5509/2017       Page 2 of 4      respondent No.8 has already purchased stamp papers worth of Rs. 7  lakhs for the said purpose. It is submitted that it was after the  aforesaid steps had been taken that the petitioner had approached the  DRAT raising a grievance against the order dated 13.05.2015 passed  by Debt Recovery Tribunal-II.   5. Learned counsel for the respondent Nos.2 and 8 submit that  though the petitioner had hived off its interest in Respondent  No.2/company by selling their shares to Sh. Nilesh Kumar, who has  taken over the management, it continues to remain a corporate  guarantor in respect of the debt due to the respondent No.1/Bank and  in those circumstances, the provisions of Section 21 would squarely  apply to it. It is further clarified that the respondent Nos.3 to 5, who  are Directors of the petitioner-company, are also guarantors of the  debt due to the respondent No.1/Bank.   6. It is not denied that the debt claimed as due and payable by the  respondent No.2 and the guarantors as per the respondent No.1/Bank  is over Rs.3,76,98,186.60, as on 24.08.2004. In such circumstances,  the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the  petitioner company cannot be treated as a party from whom debt is  due and payable to the respondent No.1/ Bank for attracting the  provisions of Section 21 of the said Act, is found to be untenable. The  submission of the learned counsel for the petitioner that the exact  amount due has yet to be determined by the DRT would have cut ice  had it been a case where the amount that has been directed by the  learned DRAT to be deposited by the petitioner, was found to be over   W.P.(C) 5509/2017       Page 3 of 4      and above the debt claimed as outstanding by the respondent  No.1/Bank. That being not the position, we decline to interfere with  the impugned order.   7. The petition is disposed of on the above terms alongwith the  pending applications.

RENU AGGARWAL   …Respondent      Through Mr.Ravi Shankar Garg, Adv.     CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE JAYANT NATH    JAYANT NATH, J. (ORAL)  1. This petition under Article 227 of the Constitution of India is filed  seeking to impugn the judgment passed by the Additional Rent Controller  (hereinafter referred to as The ARC) dated 20.10.2012, the order passed by  the SCJ-cum-RC dated 3.9.2013 and the order passed by The Rent  Controller in the appeal dated 2.2.2016 by which an eviction order has been  passed against the petitioner under section 14(1)(a) of the Delhi Rent Control  Act, 1958 (hereinafter referred to as The DRC Act).  2. The respondent (landlord) filed an eviction petition against the  petitioner under section 14(1)(a) and 14(1)(e) of the Delhi Rent Control Act.  The impugned order has been passed under section 14(1)(a) of the DRC Act.  It was averred in the petition that the respondent is the owner of shop bearing  No.1 in the property bearing No. IX/6662, Nehru Gali, Gandhi Nagar, Delhi- 110031. The respondent purchased the property on 3.9.2004 through  registered sale deed. It is urged that the last payment of rent was made by the  CM(M0 208/2016                                                                                        Page 2 of 8    petitioner on 18.9.2007 for the period 1.4.2005 till 31.3.2006 @ Rs.250/- per  month. The tenant/petitioner is said to have stopped paying rent including  payment of government taxes like house tax since 1.4.2006. A legal notice  was sent on 26.6.2008 to the petitioner. On 14.7.2008 the petitioner sent a  reply denying that the respondent is the owner of the tenanted property but  admitted about the arrears. Hence, the petition was filed seeking eviction of  the petitioner.  3. On 7.11.2009 the ARC noted that the relationship of landlord tenant,  rate of rent and the period of arrears are admitted facts. Hence, it directed the  petitioner under section 15(1) of the DRC Act to pay the rent dues @  Rs.250/- per month w.e.f. 1.4.2006 till date by depositing the calculated  amount directly in the bank account of the respondent, particulars of which  were to be furnished by the respondent. It was also directed that monthly rent  of Rs.250/- per month shall be paid by the 15 th  of each succeeding month by  depositing the same in the bank.  4. On 20.10.2012 the ARC recorded the examination in chief of the  petitioner, Shri Satish Bansal, where he has admitted the relationship of  landlord tenant between the parties, the rate of rent of Rs.250 per month and  that he is in arrears of rent w.e.f. 1.4.2006. Holding that there is nothing on  record to show that there is any default earlier on the part of the petitioner,  the ARC granted benefit to the petitioner under section 14(2) of the Act. It   held that in case the petitioner has complied with the order under section  15(1) of the DRC Act passed on 7.11.2009, there shall be no eviction of the  petitioner.   5. On 3.9.2013 on an application being filed by the respondent under  section 14(2) of the DRC Act the ARC noted that as per the records,  CM(M0 208/2016                                                                                        Page 3 of 8    pursuant to the order dated 7.11.2009 the respondent had furnished  particulars of the bank account on 7.1.2010. The petitioner thereafter  deposited rent of Rs.11,250/- on 20.1.2010, Rs.6,000/- on 30.8.2011 and  Rs.3,000/- on 24.4.2012. It was clear that the deposit of rent by the petitioner  was not in compliance of the orders passed by the court on 07.11.2009. The  ARC also noted that the petitioner has moved an application seeking  condonation of delay in depositing the rent with the plea that the rent could  not be deposited due to communication gap between the petitioner and the  office of the counsel. The ARC did not accept the plea holding that the  petitioner cannot take shelter behind the office of the counsel and claim that  he was not apprised by the counsel to deposit the rent on a monthly basis and  as such dismissed the application of the petitioner and passed an eviction  order on 3.9.2013.  6. An appeal was filed by the petitioner under section 38 of the DRC  Act. The Rent Controller noting the legal position held that the petitioner has  failed to comply with the directions passed by the ARC under section 15(1)  of the DRC Act vide order dated 7.11.2009. The Rent Controller rejected the  submission of the appellant/petitioner that defaults after passing of the order  under section 15(1) of the Act were not intentional or contemptuous or were  due to wrong advice of the counsel for the petitioner. The order notes that  there was delay in depositing of rent for several months. The appeal was thus  dismissed.  7. I have heard learned counsel for the parties. Section 14(1)(a), 14(2),  15(1) and 15(7) of the DRC Act read as follows:-  CM(M0 208/2016                                                                                        Page 4 of 8    14. Protection of tenant against eviction.- (1)  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any other  law or contract, no order or decree for the recovery of  possession of any premises shall be made by and court or  Controller in favour of the landlord against a tenant: Provided  that the Controller may, on an application made to him in the  prescribed manner, make an order for the recovery of  possession of the premises on one or more of the following  grounds only, namely:-  (a) That the tenant has neither paid nor tendered the whole of  the arrears of the rent legally recoverable from him within two  months of the date on which a landlord in the manner provided  in section 106 of the Transfers of Property Act, 1882 (4 of  1882);   ……  14(2) No order for the recovery of possession of any premises  shall be made on the ground specified in clause (a) of the  proviso to sub-section (1) if the tenant makes payment or  deposit as required by section 15:  Provided that no tenant shall be entitled to the benefit under  this sub-section, if, having obtained such benefit once in respect  of any premises, he again makes a default in the payment of rent  of those premises for three consecutive months.  …..  15(1) When a tenant can get the benefit of protection against  eviction.- (1) In every proceeding of the recovery of possession  of any premises on the ground specified in clause (a) of the  proviso to sub-section (1) of section 14, the Controller shall,  after giving the parties an opportunity of being heard, make an  order directing the tenant to pay to the landlord or deposit with  the Controller within one month of the date of the order, an  amount calculated at the rate of rent at which it was last paid for  the period for which the arrears of the rent were legally  CM(M0 208/2016                                                                                        Page 5 of 8    recoverable from the tenant including the period subsequent  thereto up to the end of the month previous to that in which  payment or deposit is made and to continue to pay or deposit,  month by month, by the fifteen of each succeeding month, a  sum equivalent to the rent at that rate  …….  15 (7) If a tenant fails to make payment or deposit as required  by this section, the Controller may order the defence against  eviction to be struck out an proceed with the hearing of the  application.”  8. The petitioner has vehemently argued that relief under section 15(7) of  the DRC Act has not been given to the petitioner. It is urged that it was on  account of the default of the lawyer and hence the petitioner should not be  penalized as he is an illiterate person. Reliance is placed on judgment of the  Supreme Court in Ram Murti vs. Bhola Nath and Another, (1984) 3 SCC  111 to contend that the ARC has sufficient powers and discretion under  section 15(7) of the Act not to strike out the defence of the tenant.  9. Learned counsel for the respondent has submitted that the petitioner  filed the application for condonation of delay in compliance of the order of  the court dated 07.11.2009 belatedly only at the stage of final arguments in  August 2013. In fact the application for condonation of delay itself states  that the said application is being filed on the oral directions of the court. He  submits that such belated application for condonation of delay has been  rightly rejected.  10. There is not much controversy on the facts. The relationship of  landlord and tenant is admitted. The fact that there are arrears of rent @  Rs.250/- per month w.e.f. 1.4.2006 is admitted. On 7.11.2009 an order was  CM(M0 208/2016",

Appellant      Through: Mr.J.P.N. Shahi, Adv.        versus   SMT SAVITA & ORS    ..... Respondents  Through: Mr. Manoj Sharma, Adv. for R- 1.  Mr. S.N. Parashar, Adv. for R-2  & 3.  CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE R.K.GAUBA       JUDGMENT (ORAL)    1. Mahesh Sharma, a non-matriculate, aged about 30 years, died in  motor vehicular accident that occurred on 28.08.2010 involving rash  driving of motor vehicle described as rural transport vehicle No. DL  IVA 3045 (RTV), it being covered by insurance policy against third  party risk with the appellant insurance company for the relevant  period.  On the claim petition (case no. 619/2010), instituted on  23.12.2010, in the wake of detailed accident report (DAR), on behalf  of the first and third respondents (the claimants), the tribunal held  inquiry and, by judgment dated 4.11.2011, awarded compensation in  the sum of Rs. 13,33,400/- with interest @ 7.5% per annum from the  date of filing of the petition i.e. 23.12.2010, fastening the liability on    MAC Appeal No. 116/2012      Page 2 of 4      the insurer.  The insurer is questioning the calculation of loss of  dependency to the tune of Rs. 11,93,400/- on the ground the element  of future prospects was wrongly added.  While fairly conceding this  ground to be correct, the learned counsel for the claimants, however,  submitted that the non-pecuniary damages on account of loss of  consortium (Rs.10,000/-) and loss of estate (Rs.5,000/-) were  inadequate and that the rate of interest levied is on the lower side.  2. In the case reported as Sarla Verma & Ors. vs. Delhi Transport  Corporation & Anr., (2009) 6 SCC 121, Supreme Court, inter-alia,  ruled that the element of future prospects of increase in income will  not be granted in cases where the deceased was “self employed” or  was working on a “fixed salary”.  Though this view was affirmed by a  bench of three Hon’ble Judges in Reshma Kumari & Ors. Vs. Madan  Mohan & Anr., (2013) 9 SCC 65, on account of divergence of views,  as arising from the ruling in Rajesh & Ors. vs. Rajbir & Ors., (2013) 9  SCC 54, the issue was later referred to a larger bench, inter-alia, by  order dated 02.07.2014 in National Insurance Company Ltd. vs.  Pushpa & Ors., (2015) 9 SCC 166.      3. Against the above backdrop, by judgment dated 22.01.2016  passed in MAC Appeal No. 956/2012 (Sunil Kumar v. Pyar Mohd.),  this Court has found it proper to follow the view taken earlier by a  learned single judge in MAC Appeal No. 189/2014 (HDFC Ergo  General Insurance Co. Ltd. v. Smt. Lalta Devi & Ors.)  decided on  12.1.2015, presently taking the decision in Reshma Kumari (Supra) as  the binding precedent, till such time the law on the subject of future    MAC Appeal No. 116/2012      Page 3 of 4      prospects for those who are “self-employed” or engaged in gainful  employment at a “fixed salary” is clarified by a larger bench of the  Supreme Court.   4. It is fairly admitted that there is no formal proof of gainful  employment or income of the deceased.  The learned counsel for the  claimants, thus, agrees, that the tribunal was right in calculating the  loss of dependency on the assumed income of Rs. 5,850/- per month,  it being the minimum wages for non-matriculates for the relevant  point of time, the calculation involving multiplier of 17.  Since the  element of future prospects has to be kept out, after deduction of 1/3 rd   towards personal and living expenses, the total loss of dependency is  worked out at (5,850 x 2÷3 x 12 x 17) Rs.7,95,600/-.    5. Following the consistent view taken by this court, non- pecuniary damages in the sum of Rs. 1 lakh each on account of loss of  love & affection and loss of consortium and Rs. 25,000/- each towards  loss of estate and funeral expenses are added.  Thus, the total  compensation awardable in the case comes to (7,95,600- + 1,00,000 +  1,00,000+ 25,000 + 25,000) Rs.10,45,600/-, rounded off to Rs.  10,46,000/-.  The compensation is, thus, reduced to Rs. 10,46,000/-.    6. Following the consistent view taken by this Court, the rate of  interest is increased to 9% per annum from the date of filing of the  petition till realization.  [see judgment dated 22.02.2016 in MAC.APP.  165/2011 Oriental Insurance Co Ltd v. Sangeeta Devi & Ors.]    MAC Appeal No. 116/2012      Page 4 of 4      7. The awarded amount shall be apportioned in the ratio directed  by the tribunal. The directions for protection of the corpus as given by  the tribunal shall hold good.  8. In terms of the order dated 31.01.2012, the insurance company  was directed  to deposit the entire awarded amount with upto date  interest with the Registrar General of this Court and upon such deposit  being made to put it in a fixed deposit receipt in UCO Bank, Delhi  High Court Branch, initially for a period of six months with provision  for auto renewal from time to time. By order dated 30.07.2012, 60%  of such amount was allowed to be released. The Registrar General  shall have the liability of the insurance worked out afresh in terms of  the modified award releasing the balance to the claimants and  refunding the excess deposited to the insurance company.  9. Statutory deposit shall be refunded.        R.K.GAUBA, J.  JULY 05, 2017  nk             ",

CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJEEV SACHDEVA  JUDGMENT  05.07.2017  SANJEEV SACHDEVA, J. (ORAL)  CS(COMM) 137/2017   1. The plaintiffs have filed this Suit inter alia for permanent  injunction thereby restraining the defendant No 1 to 6 from using the  trademark/trade name “MOTI MAHAL”/ “MOTI MAHAL Delux  Tandoori Trail” or any other Mark / trading name identical or      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 2 of 19      deceptively similar to the trademark “MOTI MAHAL” and the  MOTI MAHAL formative trademark of the plaintiffs and  using the  oval devices  and .   or any other mark/label/device which is identical/ deceptively similar  to the Plaintiffs’ oval device which would result in infringement of  Plaintiffs’ copyright.   2. Defendant No. 7 is a co-owner of the trademark alongwith the  Plaintiffs.   3. Defendants have been served with the summons of the suit.   None had appeared for the defendants on 27.03.2017.  None appears  even today.  The Defendants have failed to file Written Statement.  The defendants are proceeded ex-parte.  4. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs submits that the plaintiffs are  willing to give up the reliefs of rendition of accounts and recovery of  damages.  5. Learned counsel for the plaintiffs relies on Order VIII Rule 10  of the Code Of Civil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as the  CPC) as amended by The Commercial Courts, Commercial Division  and Commercial Appellate Division of High Courts Act , 2015  (hereinafter referred to as the Commercial Courts Act) to contend that      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 3 of 19      as the defendant 1 to 6 have failed to file Written Statement, they have  made themselves liable for a Decree of permanent Injunction.   6. Learned counsel relies upon the Judgment of a Coordinate  Bench dated 07.02.2013 in CS(OS) No.1213/2011 titled  SATYA  INFRASTRUCTURE LIMITED  & OTHERS VERSUS SATYA INFRA &  ESTATES PRIVATE LIMITED  wherein even prior to the amendment of  the CPC, in a Suit relating to infringement of Trade Mark this court  had dispensed with the requirement of the plaintiff to lead ex parte  evidence and had pronounced judgment on the basis of the affidavit  filed in support of the Plaint.     7. The present Suit for infringement has been filed by the Plaintiff  after the amendment of the CPC by the Commercial Courts Act.   8. The Suit is a Commercial dispute as defined under the  Commercial Courts Act. The provision of the CPC as amended by the  Commercial Courts Act are applicable.   9. Order VIII rule 10 as amended and applicable to Commercial  disputes reads as under:  “10. Procedure when party fails to present written  statement called for by Court.— Where any party from  whom a written statement is required under Rule 1 or  Rule 9 fails to present the same within the time permitted  or fixed by the Court, as the case may be, the Court shall  pronounce judgment against him, or make such order in  relation to the suit as it thinks fit and on the      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 4 of 19      pronouncement of such judgment a decree shall be  drawn up.  Provided further that no court shall make an order to  extend the time provided under Rule 1 of this order for  filing of the written statement.”    10. In view of the fact that the defendants 1 to 6 have failed to  appear and file their written statement, they are liable to be proceeded  with under order VIII rule 10 of CPC.    11. The Plaint is verified and supported by affidavits and statement  of truth of the Plaintiffs affirming the contents of the plaint. The  Plaintiffs have also filed an affidavit under order XI rule 6(3) of CPC  with regard to electronic record.  12. In a Suit for infringement of the same trademarks filed by the  Plaintiffs being CS (COMM) 67/2015 titled MONISH GUJRAL &  OTHERS VERSUS BEST FOOD & ANOTHER, another coordinate Bench  of this court by Judgment dated 09.08.2016 has decreed the suit.   13. In view of the above, I am of the opinion that, this is a fit case,  where instead of requiring the plaintiffs to lead ex parte evidence,  judgment can be pronounced forthwith against defendants 1 to 6.   14. The Plaintiffs have pleaded that they are the registered  proprietors of the well-known trademark ‘MOTI MAHAL’ and MOTI      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 5 of 19      MAHAL Formative marks in India and in many jurisdictions of the  world.  15. The plaintiffs claim to be the owners of the copyright in the  oval devices  and    represented in the stylized manner and artistic impression. The said  oval device is an original artistic work and is protected under Section  2 (c) of the Copyright Act, 1957.    16. It is stated that the Plaintiffs’ trade mark MOTI MAHAL,  MOTI MAHAL Formatives marks and its oval devices are well- known marks as envisaged under the provisions of section 2(1) (zg) of  the Trade Marks Act, 1999.  17. It is contended that Defendant Nos. 1 to 6 are ex-franchisee of  the Plaintiff No. 3 and are into the business of providing hospitality  services. It is contended that the Defendants are continuing to carry on  their operations under the trademark MOTI MAHAL DELUX  Tandoori Trail despite the Franchisee Agreement having being  terminated on 28 th  October 2015.   18. It is stated that the Defendant Nos. 1 to 6 being the ex- franchisee of the Plaintiffs are clearly aware of the ownership and  notoriety of the trademark MOTI MAHAL, MOTI MAHAL DELUX      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 6 of 19      TANDOORI TRAIL and MOTI MAHAL Formative marks of the  Plaintiffs as well as the goodwill and reputation enjoyed by the  plaintiffs in and to the said trademarks and being a party to the  Franchisee Agreement are aware that they have no rights in any  manner whatsoever to use the trademark MOTI MAHAL/ MOTI  MAHAL Delux Tandoori Trail.  19. It is contended that such continuous use by the Defendant Nos.  1 to 6 is most likely to cause confusion in the minds of the consuming  public that there is some association between the Plaintiffs and the  Defendant Nos. 1 to 6, when actually there is none.   20. Tracing the History of the Trademarks, it is stated that, in the  year 1920 the first restaurant was opened by Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral,  the grandfather of the Plaintiff No. 1 and Defendant No. 7 and the  father – in – law of the Plaintiff No. 2 in Peshawar (now in Pakistan).  In 1947, after the partition of India and Pakistan, he moved to the  Daryaganj area of Delhi and opened the first restaurant MOTI  MAHAL of Darya Ganj. In and around 1948, Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral  also opened a Hotel by the name MOTI MAHAL Hotel in Darya  Ganj.   21. Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral, it is stated,  entered into a partnership  agreement dated 5 th  September 1951 with Mr. Thakar Das Maggo,  Mr. Kundan Lal Jaggi, Mr. Karam Chand Sarwal and Mr. Dharam      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 7 of 19      Singh Uberoi by virtue of which the partners agreed to run the  business in the name of MOTI MAHAL HOTEL. As per the  partnership agreement Mr. Karam Chand Sarwal and Mr. Dharam  Singh were to have no concern with or interest in the restaurant  business of MOTI MAHAL Restaurant and further if, at any time in  future, Mr. Karam Chand Sarwal or Mr. Dharam Singh retired from  the said partnership, or the partnership is dissolved, they shall have no  right to use the name MOTI MAHAL in any business which they start  jointly or severally.  22. It is pleaded that, whilst the MOTI MAHAL restaurant  continued to bloom, the hotel business did not do very well and was  eventually closed. On 16 th  February 1959 Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral  became the absolute owner of the property at Darya Ganj.    23. Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral and Mr. Nand Lal Gujral (father of the  Plaintiff No. 1 and Defendant No. 7 and husband of the Plaintiff No.  2) with an intention to expand their restaurant business started a  restaurant in South Extension Part II, New Delhi under the name and  style of MOTI MAHAL DELUX and entered into a Partnership  agreement dated 18 th  August 1975 with one Mr. Sanjiv Kohli and Ms.  Manorma Kohli, Mr. Kailash Chander Sarwal and Ms. Nirmala  Chadha.   The word DELUX was added to the name to distinguish it  from the main MOTI MAHAL restaurant in Darya Ganj.      CS(COMM)137/2017           Page 8 of 19      24. Mr. Kundan Lal Gujral and Mr. Nand Lal Gujral further entered  into other partnerships and opened other restaurant at Shop No. M-30  and M-30A in partnership with others by the name of MOTI MAHAL  DELUXE – II in the year 1977.   25. The MOTI MAHAL Restaurant at Darya Ganj was not doing  good business on account of which the family of the Plaintiffs decided  to retire from the said partnership. The Plaintiffs’ family relinquished  their shares in the said partnership to one Mr. Yoginder Nath  Chaddha, Mr. Avinash Chander Chaddha, Mr. Kushal Deep and Mr.  Vinod Chaddha and permitted them to use the mark MOTI MAHAL  only with respect to the restaurant at Netaji Subhash Place, Darya  Ganj.   26. It is contended that though the Gujral family transferred its  shares in the MOTI MAHAL Restaurant at Netaji Subhash Place,  Darya Ganj, they retained the exclusive right to use the trademark  MOTI MAHAL and precluded the transferees from using their  trademark MOTI MAHAL for any other restaurant.  After  relinquishing their shares in the Darya Ganj restaurant, the Jaggi  family ceased to have any concern with the restaurant business at  Darya Ganj or indeed MOTI MAHAL brand. The Gujral family  continued to expand the business and diligently protecting its  trademark rights in MOTI MAHAL.       CS(COMM)137/2017",

Petitioner      Through: Mr.Ankur Chhibber, Adv.        versus     UNION OF INDIA AND ORS   ..... Respondents  Through: Mr.Dev P. Bhardwaj, CGSC         CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE SANJIV KHANNA  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE NAVIN CHAWLA    SANJIV KHANNA, J. (Oral)     1. Mr.Satyendra Kumar Jha in this writ petition impugns the  decision of the respondents deploying Gurjeet Singh, the 4 th   respondent, for security duties at Embassy of India, Kathmandu and  Consulate General of India, Birgunj (Nepal).  2. The petitioner submits that the petitioner and not the 4 th   respondent should have been sent for the said posting as the said  respondent was earlier deputed for duties at Haiti between 27.10.2010  to 11.11.2011.  Reference is made to the Clause (g) of the Standard    WP (C) 1941/2017 Page 2    Operative Procedure (SOP).  It is also pleaded that 4 th  respondent had  not applied within the stipulated cut-off date pursuant to the  notification dated 26.06.2015 for deployment in Nepal. Accordingly,  the 4 th  respondent had not participated in the examination held on  28.07.2015 and 29.07.2015 but had participated in the examination/  interview held on 17.08.2015 and 18.08.2015.  3. We would take the second contention first.  The respondents in  the counter-affidavit have stated that the Central Industrial Security  Force (CISF) has more than 300 units scattered all over the country  and some times it becomes quite difficult to receive nominations from  all sectors before due or cut off date.  In the present case, the 4 th   respondent had submitted the application form with hard and soft copy  on 04.07.2015, which nomination form along with 41 other  nomination forms were received on 27.07.2015 i.e. one day before the  written examination and interview scheduled to begin from  28.07.2015.  To be fair and just and give opportunity to such officers  who were not to be blamed and at fault, another test and interview  were held on 17.08.2015 and 18.08.2015. The written test and  interview were held by the same Board i.e. without changing the  Constitution of the Board.  Thus the said 42 officers were given an  opportunity for selection and to compete with others on merits.   Aforesaid explanation is a complete answer and negates, the second  contention. The submission of the petitioner has to be rejected.    WP (C) 1941/2017 Page 3    4. On the first aspect, we would reproduce paragraph (g) of the  Standard Operative Procedure, which reads as under:-  “(g) Implementation of “Cooling” off period (03 years)  for all deputations i.e. UN Mission; Indian Mission &  Deputation within India (Except SPC & NSG who can  apply any time).  (Preference will be given to officers &  men who have not done any deputation UN/Indian  Mission abroad earlier.)”.    5. The 4 th  respondent in the present case was deputed to Haiti  between 27.10.2010 to 11.11.2011.  He would obviously not violate  the cooling off period of three years. He was eligible and could have  been considered for another foreign assignment for deployment in UN  Mission/Indian Mission abroad.  6. Learned counsel for the petitioner has made reference to the  bracketed portion which states that preference would be given to  officers who have not earlier done any deputation in the UN/Indian  Mission abroad.  The respondents on the said aspect have submitted  and clarified that 4 th  respondent had secured 213 marks in the written  examination, whereas, the petitioner had secured 199.5 marks. In view  of the substantial difference in the marks, competent authority took  conscious and considered decision to depute the best officer/personnel  for the foreign assignment.   7. Learned counsel for the petitioner has drawn our attention to the  judgment dated 15.10.2012 in WP(C) 6498/2012, Nishant Sankale v.    WP (C) 1941/2017 Page 4    Union of India & Ors and submits that bracketed portion of Clause  (g) relating to preference is mandatory and not merely  recommendatory. We have considered the said judgment and  reasoning given therein.  The said judgment does not hold or observe  that all officers/ personnel earlier deputed to Indian Mission or UN  Mission abroad are to be ignored, in preference to those who have not  been earlier deployed. Paragraph 10 of the said judgment holds that  the Directorate General while taking the final decision would take into  consideration whether one of the person/personnel has had the benefit  of an earlier foreign assignment.  If this is so, the said person could be  ignored and preference could be given to the person next below in the  order. In the present case however, the respondents on examining the  relevant facts and on account of difference of marks have sanctioned  deputation of the 4 th  respondent. Clause (g) quoted above prescribes  three years as cooling off period.  This three years bar and prohibition  from posting the same officer on deputation at the UN Mission or  Indian Mission aboard, is not violated in the present case. It may be  relevant here to quote portions of the decision of in Nishant Sankele  (supra) which are as under:  “13. Now, even with respect to promotions, nobody has  a vested right to be promoted. The only right is to a fair  consideration for being promoted and if the parameters  of fair consideration are stipulated, the consideration for  purposes of promotion has to be as per the parameters  stipulated. However, this principle would not be  applicable to matters pertaining to posting. Nobody has     WP (C) 1941/2017 Page 5    a vested right to be posted at a place. No doubt, where  the employer, for purposes of transparency, has framed  guidelines on the subject, the same have to be  considered and taken into account and unless shown that  the policy is exhaustive of all the circumstances and  situations which may be encountered it cannot be said  that the policy has to be applied as a statute.   14. Needless to state, a policy guideline on a posting is  always treated indicative of and not conclusively  determinative of on the subject of a posting.   15. Now, there is no criteria laid down in the policy on  the basis of which a merit position has to be drawn.  Thus, the panel prepared by the board in which  petitioner was placed at serial No.1 had a fair element of  the subjective satisfaction of the members of the board  to place petitioner at serial No.1 of the merit panel. It is  in this context it assumes importance of there being  fairness in not only the preparation of the select panel  but even the final decision taken, to send a particular  person on a UN Mission Foreign Posting. Merely  because the petitioner was at serial No.1 of the select  panel would not confer upon him an indefeasible right  to be sent to the foreign mission posting. We find  fairness in action when DG CISF took the view that  since the persons at serial No.1 and 2 of the panel had  the benefit of a foreign posting in the past, Anand  Saxena who had none should be made the Contingent  Commander.  16. We only wish to bring out our view that issues of  vested rights and rights simpliciter in the domain of  service law have to be considered not pedantically but  keeping in view the nature of the dispute brought before    WP (C) 1941/2017 Page 6    a Court. In a matter pertaining to posting, the Executive  must have a free hand and even if there exists a policy  with respect to posting the same cannot be treated as an  edict and would always be subject to not only the  exigencies of service but even a fair distributive  postings; if a particular posting carries extra perks. We  highlight that UN Mission foreign posting entitles those  sent on deputation to a Foreign Allowance, which is  paid in US dollars and also gives an exposure of a kind  to the person posted which the person may not get in  India and thus the concept of distributive justice may be  applicable in the decisions of such kind.”      Reading of the aforesaid paragraphs would indicate that the  authorities are given a degree of flexibility in the matter of posting of  such nature, while ensuring that fairness and transparency are not a  casuality. Arbitrariness and nepotism are impermissible. Policy  guidelines on the posting are not treated as a statutory mandate and the  preference clause conclusively and affirmatively determinative of on  the subject of posting. We therefore, find no merits in the second  contention of the petitioner as well.   8. Another contention raised by the petitioner is that 4 th  respondent  had submitted an undertaking that he was not in the promotion zone.  However, the 4 th  respondent is at Sl. No.101 in the seniority list of  Deputy Commandant and his juniors in the seniority list upto Sl.  No.123 have been promoted vide order dated 10.02.2017. The  respondents have pointed out that these are Local Rank Promotions    WP (C) 1941/2017 Page 7    which are made by Directorate General.  These are not regular  promotions. No financial benefit accrues and is paid. In view of the  abovesaid explanation given by the respondents on third aspect, we do  not find any reason to quash deployment of the 4 th  respondent.  9. In view of the aforesaid discussion, we do not find any merit in  the present petition. The same is dismissed with no order as to cost.

No.3743/2014   Page 1 of 14    $~6.  * IN  THE  HIGH  COURT  OF  DELHI  AT  NEW  Delhi  + Date of Decision: 05.07.2017  %  W.P.(C) 3743/2014   UNION OF INDIA & ORS  ..... Petitioner      Through: Mr. Rajan Sabharwal, Adv.         versus     NASEEM NAWAB  ..... Respondent  Through: Ms. Padma Priya, Adv. for DHCLSC     CORAM:  HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE VIPIN SANGHI  HON'BLE MS. JUSTICE REKHA PALLI    VIPIN SANGHI, J. (ORAL)    1. The Union of India has preferred the present writ petition to assail the  order dated 24.03.2014 passed by the Central Administrative Tribunal,  Principal Bench, New Delhi (the Tribunal) in O.A. No.1249/2013, whereby  the said O.A. preferred by the respondent has been allowed and the tribunal  has directed the petitioner to reinstate the respondent in service forthwith.  The period of her absence from duty has been directed to be treated as leave  of the kinds due, including extraordinary leave.  The back wages have been  denied to the respondent during the period from the date of her removal  from service, to the date of her reinstatement in service.        W.P.(C.) No.3743/2014   Page 2 of 14      2. The respondent was working as a Clerk, Stores Branch, Headquarter  Office, Baroda House, New Delhi in the railways.  She was working in the  Receipt Section during the period 2003-04 and 2004-05.  She absented from  duty unauthorisedly i.e. without obtaining leave for long periods of time  and, consequently, on 10.03.2005 inquiry proceedings were initiated against  her under Rule 9 of the Railway Service (Discipline & Appeal) Rules, 1968.    3. The Statement of Articles of Charge were as follows:  “Smt. Naseem Nawab, Clerk, Stores Branch, Head Quarter  Office, Baroda House, New Delhi while working in Receipt  Section during period 2003-04 and 2004-05 was found to have  committed serious irregularities in as much as:-  (i) She is a habitual absentee and do not take prior sanction  of leave.     (ii) She remained unauthorisedly absent from office since  May, 2003 and failed to attend office in spite of repeated  reminders.    (iii) She has neglected her duties and shown total disinterest  to work for the administration.     By this act of omission and commission Smt. Naseem  Nawab, Clerk, Stores Branch acted in a manner unbecoming of  a Railway Servant and thus violated Rule 3.1(i), (ii) and (iii) of  Railway Service Conduct Rules, 1966”.    4. The statement of imputation of misconduct and misbehaviour, on the  basis of which the Articles of Charge were framed, reads as follows:  “1. Based on poor record of presence of Smt. Naseem  Nawab, in office during January, 2000 to 14th February,  2005, it was ordered to issue SF-5 to her for neglecting her      W.P.(C.) No.3743/2014   Page 3 of 14    duties as well as for unauthorized absence from duty.    2. The following record of her attendance shows that she is  a habitual absentee with total disregard to the administrative  norms.  The following statement also shows that she has not  bothered to take prior sanction before proceeding on leave.       Year Total  Days  Sat. Sun/  G.Holidays   (Days)  Working  Days  Present  (Days)  Absent  (Days)         2000 366 120 246 159 83  2001 365 121 244 133 121  2002 365 116 249 88 200  Upto  April  2003  120 41 79 11 85     Note: form May, 2003 she is absent till today.  3. Repeated counseling of this employee has not resulted in  any improvement in her attitude and availability in office.  It is  also seen that whenever she applies for leave, her leave  application does not bear her address.     Thus by the above acts of omission and commission, Smt.  Naseem Nawab, while working as Clerk in Receipt Section,  failed to maintain absolute integrity, exhibited lack of devotion  towards her duties and acted in a manner unbecoming of a  Railway Servant, thereby contravening Rule 3.1(i), (ii) and (iii)  of Railway Service Conduct Rule, 1966”.  (emphasis supplied)  5. The list of documents relied upon by the Department included the  leave applications submitted by the respondent on 21.08.2003 and  20.08.2003, as well as the communication addressed to the respondent on  28.08.2003, 06.11.2003 and 20/24.08.2003.  Pertinently, it also included the      W.P.(C.) No.3743/2014   Page 4 of 14    attendance record of the respondent for the period January 2000 to  14.02.2005.  The charge sheet did not list any witness by whom the Articles  of Charge were proposed to be sustained.   6. Repeated attempts were made to serve the respondent with the charge  sheet, firstly, by registered post, then by deputing a senior clerk to deliver  the same to her at her residential address – which was found locked, and  eventually by issuing public notice in leading newspapers.   7. The inquiry officer proceeded with the inquiry ex-parte since the  respondent did not participate.  After holding several hearings – during  which the respondent did not participate, the inquiry officer made his report  on 14.05.2007.  In the inquiry report, the inquiry officer noted the  endeavours made to serve the respondent and to grant her sufficient  opportunity to participate in the inquiry.  He also discussed the documentary  evidence placed before him and concluded, on the basis of the relied upon  documents listed in Annexure-3 to the charge sheet, that all the charges  levelled against the respondent stood proved.    8. The disciplinary authority upon receipt of the inquiry report sent a  communication on 21.05.2007 to the respondent requiring her to make a  representation within ten days.  It appears that the respondent sent a  representation and, in pursuance thereof, a fresh inquiry was held on the  same charges.    9. The respondent participated in the inquiry proceedings held on  03.11.2009. However, she stopped participating in the inquiry thereafter.   Consequently, a fresh inquiry report was made on 16.12.2011.  Pertinently,      W.P.(C.) No.3743/2014   Page 5 of 14    all this while the respondent continued to remain absent from service.  10. Finally, the disciplinary authority passed the order of removal from  service against the respondent on 05.07.2012 on the ground of her habitual  absentism, firstly, from 12.06.1986, secondly from May 2003, and thirdly  from 30.07.2010.  11. The respondent then preferred her departmental appeal on the ground  that she had sent her leave application on 21.08.2003 for grant of leave from  01.08.2003 to 31.08.2003.  She also sent a representation on 28.04.2003,  stating that her son was under medical treatment and, therefore, she was  unable to present herself in the office.  She claimed that her absence was on  account of compelling reasons.   However, she did not deny the factum of  her absence from duty during the period in question, and did not claim that  during that period, or any part thereof, her leave had been sanctioned.   She  claimed that the inquiry had not been conducted in accordance with the  principles of natural justice, and that no evidence has been adduced against  her.   12. The appellate authority rejected her appeal on 28.12.2002.  A perusal  of the order passed by the disciplinary authority as well as the appellate  authority shows that they are detailed and considered orders.   The order of  the appellant authority shows that the respondent appeared for personal  hearing.  During the said personal hearing, she explained her personal  circumstances, namely, that one of her two sons were suffering from  prolonged anxiety neurosis while the other was working.  Her husband had  deserted her and that it was not possible for her to attend the office, leaving      W.P.(C.) No.3743/2014   Page 6 of 14    her younger son alone.  She maintained that her absence was not wilful and  requested for sympathetic consideration.   Thus, it would appear that the  respondent did not dispute the factum of her unauthorised absence.  She  claimed that her absence was a result of her personal circumstances, while  not denying the same unauthorised.  The appellate order takes note of the  fact that earlier as well, she had been removed for unauthorised absence by  an order passed on 27.05.1989 but was subsequently reinstated after  reducing the penalty vide order dated 12.10.1992.  However, her conduct  had not improved and she continued to remain absent on leave without pay  on several occasions.  The respondent then preferred a revision before the  revisionary authority, which too rejected the said revision petition on  07.03.2013 giving reasons for the same.  Consequently, the respondent  preferred the aforesaid O.A. which, as aforesaid, has been allowed by the  tribunal.         13. The tribunal while allowing the O.A. has observed that even if the  delinquent employee did not participate in the proceedings, “the Enquiry  Officer cannot blindly say that the charge of unauthorised absence has been  proved against such delinquent employee.” The tribunal placed reliance on  the letter dated 18.04.1990 of the railways, bearing No. E(D&A) 90 RG 6- 34, which contained the instructions as to how ex-parte inquiry should be  held.  The extract from this letter relied upon by the tribunal read as follows:  “4. It is now clarified that the provisions of Rule 14(ii) of the  RS(D&A) Rules may not be resorted to where it becomes  necessary to proceed in an ex-parte manner against charged  Railway Servants who are absconding or are on unauthorized  absence and the charge sheets are returned undelivered.  In      W.P.(C.) No.3743/2014   Page 7 of 14    such cases, while conducting the ex-parte proceedings, the  entire gamut of the enquiry has to be gone through.",

Appellant Through: Mr. Malaya Kumar Chand, Advocate with appellant in person. versus SWARNA KUMARI ..... Respondent Through: Mr.S.C. Singhal, Mr. B.S. Chauhan, Advocates CORAM: HON'BLE MR. JUSTICE P.S.TEJI P.S.TEJI, J (Oral) O R D E R % 1. The present appeal has been filed under Section 96 CPC read with Order XLI against the judgment and decree dated 31.08.2016 passed by the Court below vide which the respondent/plaintiff was held entitled for the decree of possession of the suit property and the appellants/defendants were directed to handover the physical and vacant possession of the said property to the respondent/plaintiff. The respondent/plaintiff was also held to be entitled for decree of mesne profits/damages @ Rs.6,000/- per month. 2. As per record, the respondent/plaintiff had filed a suit for possession, damages and mesne profits against the appellants/ defendants. The appellant no.1 was the widow of late Sh.Narender Kumar Suri, brother of the respondent/plaintiff and appellants no.2 and 3 were their son and daughter. Late Sh.Narender Kumar Suri sold R.F.A. No. 335/2017 Page 2 of 6 the property no.B-93, Jhilmil Colony, Shahdara, Delhi i.e. half portion of ground floor up to the ceiling level to his sister i.e. respondent/ plaintiff for a sale consideration of Rs.3,20,000/- and had executed an agreement dated 23.02.2011 along with affidavit, will, receipt, possession letter, GPA etc. On 16.11.2011, Sh.Narender Kumar Suri had expired and prior to that he was allowed to stay in the suit property for one year. It was alleged that despite expiry of one year, the appellants/defendants did not vacate the suit property. A legal notice dated 07.11.2012 was served upon the appellants. It was claimed that the appellants/defendants were in unauthorized occupation of the suit property w.e.f. 15.11.2012. 3. In the written statement, preliminary objections regarding lack of pecuniary jurisdiction, suppression of material facts and non- maintainability of the suit under Order 7 Rule 11 CPC were taken. It was alleged that the suit property was sold for Rs.26 lacs to the plaintiff, out of which only Rs.3,20,000/- was paid by the plaintiff and remaining amount was never paid. The sale deed was executed in good faith to save the fund of the stamp duty. It was further submitted that all the acts were done in the presence of appellant no.1. 4. After the completion of pleadings by the parties, following issues were framed by the Court below: a) Whether the suit has not been properly valued for the purpose of court fees and jurisdiction? OPD b) Whether plaintiff is entitled for decree of possession of the suit property, as prayed? OPP R.F.A. No. 335/2017 Page 3 of 6 c) Whether plaintiff is entitled for decree of damages, if so, at what rate and for what period? OPP d) Relief. 5. So far as the question regarding valuation of the suit is concerned, it is apparent from the record that the suit was valued as per the claim of the respondent/plaintiff, whereas the objection raised by the appellants/defendants was that the market value of the suit property was Rs.35 lacs and the Court below had no jurisdiction to try and entertain the same. In support of its case, the respondent/plaintiff had examined her son Sh.Sanjay Kumar Bhasin as PW1. She had also examined Sh.Prayas, LDC from the office of Sub-Registrar-VIII who had proved on record the Agreement to Sell and GPA as Ex.PW1/2 and Ex.PW1/3 respectively. The documents executed by late Sh.Narender Kumar Suri i.e. affidavit, will, receipt, possession letter and site plan were proved as Ex.PW1/4 to Ex.PW1/8 respectively. On the other hand, the appellants/defendants had not brought on record any evidence to controvert the case of the plaintiff or to support their plea that the suit was not properly valued for the purpose of pecuniary jurisdiction. No government valuer or architect had been produced before the trial court by the appellants to substantiate their claim that the suit was not properly valued. 6. So far as the next question i.e. whether the plaintiff was entitled for decree of possession of the suit property is concerned, it was proved on record by the respondent/plaintiff that the suit property was purchased by the plaintiff from late Sh.Narender Kumar Suri vide R.F.A. No. 335/2017 Page 4 of 6 documents Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/7 and the said documents were duly registered in the Office of Sub Registrar. It was the claim of the plaintiff that Sh.Narender Kumar Suri was permitted to stay in the suit property after selling the same to the plaintiff for a period of one year and he expired on 16.11.2011. It was also so claimed that after the death of late Sh.Narender Kumar Suri, she permitted his family members to reside in the suit property for some time and when she requested the appellants/defendants to vacate the same, they refused, therefore, a legal notice Ex.Pw1/9 was issued to them but despite its receipt, they did not vacate the suit property. 7. As per the documents Ex.PW1/2 to Ex.PW1/7, late Sh.Narender Kumar Suri sold the suit premises to the respondent/plaintiff and he was permitted to stay in the same for a period of one year as they were brother and sister. It was not disputed by the appellants/defendants that the sale documents with regard to selling of the suit property to the respondent/plaintiff were duly executed and registered in the Office of Sub Registrar. The dispute raised by the appellants/ defendants was that the suit property was sold for a sum of Rs.26 lacs and the plaintiff had paid only Rs.3,20,000/- and the remaining amount was never paid, but they had failed to establish such a plea. On the basis of documentary and oral evidence produced on record by the respondent/plaintiff, she had proved her entitlement for the possession of suit property. 8. The next and the last question remained was whether the respondent/plaintiff was entitled for decree of damages. Since it had R.F.A. No. 335/2017 Page 5 of 6 been established on record that the legal notice dated 07.11.2012 was served upon the appellants/defendants and the fact that the plaintiff was entitled for possession of suit property, the appellants/defendants were held to be in unauthorized possession of the suit premises after 15.11.2012. Therefore, there was nothing wrong in awarding the damages @ Rs.6,000/- per month w.e.f. 16.11.2012 in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants. 9. During the course of hearing of the present appeal, counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, on instructions offered that if the appellant/defendant is ready to handover the vacant possession of the suit property within a period of six months, the respondent/plaintiff is ready to forego the amount of mesne profits till the date of vacation. 10. Counsel for the appellant, on instructions of the appellants/defendants, agreed to the offer of the respondent/plaintiff. 11. It is agreed between the parties that the appellants/defendants shall vacate the suit premises by 31st December 2017 and shall handover the possession thereof to the respondent/plaintiff. The appellants/defendants further undertook to continue to pay the water and electricity charges, as are being paid as on today. It is further agreed that the appellants shall not create any third party interest in the suit property. 12. On the other hand, the attorney of the plaintiff/respondent undertook that he will forego the mesne profits till 31st December R.F.A. No. 335/2017 Page 6 of 6 2017, if the vacant possession of the suit property is handed over by the appellants/defendants by 31.12.2017. 13. In view of the aforesaid settlement arrived at between the parties, the judgment and decree passed by the court below is upheld and the same would be stood satisfied with the agreed terms as per the statement made by them. 14. Learned counsel for the respondent, on instructions, submits that he would not press the execution petition pending before the trial court till 31st December 2017. 15. Since the matter has been amicably settled between the parties, the plaintiff/respondent would be entitled to claim the benefit of Section 89 of the CPC with regard to the court fee paid for claiming mesne profits. 16. In the light of the above settlement, the present appeal filed by the appellant is disposed of as settled. 17. Decree sheet be prepared accordingly. 18. A copy of the order be given dasti to counsel for both the sides. P.S.TEJI, J JULY 05, 2017 dd/pkb ",

The respondent no.7  Shakuntala also died during the pendency of this petition and the    CM(M) No.1282/2012                                                                                                   Page 2 of 12    applications filed for substitution of her legal representative were  dismissed on 30 th  November, 2016 recording that she was only a  proforma respondent and no relief was claimed against her.  The  order dated 30 th  November, 2016 also records that service of the  notice of the petition was complete.   4. The counsels have been heard.   5. The suit from which this petition arises was instituted in  April, 1991 seeking i) declaration to the effect that the compromise  dated 25 th  February, 1991 entered into between the defendant no.1  and defendants no.2 to 4 in the suit and the consequent order dated  9 th  May, 1991 of the Court of Smt. Aruna Suresh, Additional Senior  Sub Judge, Delhi in three appeals titled a) Dhare Vs. Kehar Singh,  b) Pritam Singh Vs. Kehar Singh and c) Mehtab Singh Vs. Kehar  Singh, filed by the defendants no.2 to 4 in the suit against the  defendant no.1 were all procured malafidedly, dishonestly,  collusively, fraudulently and were illegal, void and without  jurisdiction and not binding on the plaintiffs and did not affect the  rights, title and interest of the plaintiffs as successors in interest of  one Smt. Risalo in the land detailed in para no.24 of the plaint; and,  ii) a decree of permanent injunction restraining the defendants from  interfering with the possession of the plaintiffs of the said land and  from transferring the land to anyone else.  6. It is not in dispute that during the pendency of the suit, i)  defendant no.2 Dhare died on 6 th  December, 1997 and the  application belatedly filed for substitution of his legal  representatives was dismissed on 30 th  March, 2011; ii) the    CM(M) No.1282/2012                                                                                                   Page 3 of 12    defendant no.1 also died; iii) the defendant no.3 also died and the  application belatedly filed for substitution of his legal representative  was also dismissed; iv) the plaintiff no.1 Ishwar Singh also died and  the application for substitution of his legal representatives was also  dismissed on 30 th  March, 2011.  7. The sole surviving defendant Mehtab Singh, in the  circumstances, moved the application contending that with the  abatement of the suit qua defendants whose heirs had not been  brought on record and qua one of the plaintiffs whose heirs had also  not been brought on record, the suit against him also stood abated  and which application has, vide the impugned order, been allowed  by the learned Civil Judge.  8. The learned Civil Judge, in the impugned order, has recorded  i) that it was the contention of the defendant / applicant Mehtab  Singh that if the suit was permitted to continue against him, the  same will lead to passing of conflicting decrees not permissible in  law; and, ii) that it was the contention of the counsel for the  surviving plaintiffs that they were the lawful owner of the property  and there would be no conflicting decrees.  9. The learned Civil Judge, in the impugned order, has reasoned  i) that the claim of the plaintiffs against the defendants was joint,  composite and not independent; ii) that the relief of permanent  injunction was consequential to the relief of declaration; iii) that the  declaration sought by the plaintiffs was not of their ownership on  the basis of sale deeds in their favour but of compromise inter se  the defendants being null and void; iv) that thus there was no    CM(M) No.1282/2012                                                                                                   Page 4 of 12    independent and divisible claim against each of the defendants; v)  that all the defendants except one had expired and the suit already  stood abated against the deceased defendants; vi) that it is settled  law that where the claim against each of the defendants is not  independent or divisible, then on abatement of the suit against one  of the defendants, the suit as well abates; and, vii) that if it was held  otherwise, it would result in conflicting decrees between the  defendants.   10. I have at the outset enquired from the counsel for the  petitioners as to how this petition invoking Article 227 of the  Constitution of India has been preferred and the suit having been  dismissed, whether not the remedy of the petitioners / plaintiffs  against the order of dismissal of the suit was of preferring an appeal  under Section 96 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC).  The  order impugned, of dismissal of suit as abated so far as against the  surviving defendant / respondent no.1 Mehtab Singh, is on the  finding of the claim of petitioners / plaintiffs in the suit against  defendants no.1 to 4 being not divisible and the suit, on having  stood abated against defendants no.1 to 3, abating against surviving  defendant / respondent no.1 Mehtab Singh also.  This is an  adjudication on merits and would qualify as a ‘decree’ within the  meaning of Section 2(2) of the CPC, being an adjudication  conclusively determining the rights of the petitioners / plaintiffs and  defendant / respondent no.1 Mehtab Singh with regard to the matter  in controversy in the suit.  Order XXII Rule 9(2) provides for an  application for setting aside of abatement only where no application    CM(M) No.1282/2012                                                                                                   Page 5 of 12    is filed and Order XLIII Rule 1(k) provides for appeal against an  order under Rule 9 of Order XXII refusing to set aside abatement or  dismissal only.  Thus Order XXII Rule 9 is in the nature of a default  procedure and whereagainst appeal is provided.  However holding a  proceeding as abated, on merits, would fall under Section 2(2) of  CPC as aforesaid.    11. The counsel for the petitioners / plaintiffs states that no  decree sheet has been prepared.  Attention in this regard is drawn to  the impugned order not even directing preparation of a decree.   12. I am unable to agree. The remedies against judgments, orders  and decrees are governed by the CPC and other statutes and are not  dependent upon preparation of a decree. Even if decree has not been  prepared, it was incumbent upon the petitioners / plaintiffs to apply  to the Court for preparation of a decree and / or to prefer an appeal  seeking exemption from filing copy of the decree, stating reasons  therefor.   13. As far back as in Rampal Singh Vs. Abdul Hamid AIR 1928  Oudh 362 (FB), it was held that an order directing abatement of the  suit is appealable. The same is the view in K.R. Subramania Iyer  Vs. Venkataramier AIR 1916 Mad. 1068 (FB) and Anna Tatoba  Jadhav Vs. Anna Bhau Chougule AIR 1982 Bom 174.  Similarly,  it was held in Niranjan Nath Vs. Afzal Hussain AIR 1916 Lahore  245 (FB), Gurdial Singh Vs. Rattan Singh 1980 Punjab Law  Journal 89 (DB), Brij Jivan Lal Vs. Shiam Lal AIR 1950 All 57  and Achhar Vs. Koondi AIR 1958 J&K 53 (DB) that if the order of  abatement is the result of the adjudication upon the rights of the    CM(M) No.1282/2012                                                                                                   Page 6 of 12    parties with respect to a matter in controversy, it amounts to a  decree and is appealable as such. Reference may also be made to  Thadikonda Gopalaratnam Vs. Thadikonda Lakshmikantam AIR  1943 Mad 569 and Purushottamdas Sakalchand Vs. Devkaran  Kesheoji AIR 1939 Nagpur 39 (DB) holding that a order dismissing  the suit as having abated will be appealable.   14. In Ganpat Ram Vs. Vishnu Dutt 1978 Current Law Journal  (Civil) 158 Punjab and Suppu Nayakan Vs. Perumal Chetty AIR  1917 Madras 285 (DB), it was held that when the suit is dismissed  as having abated and the propriety of dismissal on that ground is  questioned, an appeal will lie as if from a decree.  Similarly in  Bhanwar Singh Vs. Man Singh AIR 1954 Ajm 43, it was held that  where on abatement of a suit so far as the deceased concerned, the  Court dismissed the whole suit against all parties, an appeal would  lie.",

Though for the disposal of all the writ petitions on hand, it is may  not be absolutely essential to trace the entire history of the litigation between  the parties, a brief narration would provide the broad canvas on which they  are fought and throw light upon the remedy needed to cure the malady.  Therefore, the history is recorded as follows:-  (i) A Society by name Yadhava Kalvi Nidhi was formed in the year  1962  and  registered  under  the  Societies  Registration  Act,  1860,  with  Registration No.85 of 1962, as seen from the Certificate dated 30.11.1962.",

The said  Palanisamy died intestate in the year 1995. The first Plaintiff and first  defendant became Class-I legal heirs entitled to equal share in the suit  property. First Defendant taking advantage of the fact that the Plaintiff  was  not  well  and  entered  into  an  agreement  with  the  Second  Defendant  on  07.03.2001.   At  the  intervention  of  the  Plaintiff  and  Panchayatdars, the above agreement was cancelled on 26.4.2001.  In  view of the family arrangement it was agreed to sell 23 cents in order  http://www.judis.nic.in 3  to clear the debts of the family. When the matter stood thus, the First  Defendant  violating the right of the Plaintiff alienated the entire suit  property  in  favour  of  2nd Defendant  to  defraud  the  share  of  the  Plaintiff. Hence the suit for partition.  Pending suit she has executed a  Will dated2.7.2003 in favour of the 2nd Plaintiff.  On the strength of the  above Will the second Plaintiff was brought on record. 2.(b)  Defendant  No.1  remained  exparte.  Second  Defendant  filed a statement to the effect that the First Plaintiff has relinquished  her  share  in  favour  of  the   Second  Plaintiff and  his  son.   First  defendant and son effected many alienation.  The First Plaintiff has not  challenged the alienation. Now, suit has been filed to non-suit  the sale  in his favour dated 26.12.2001.  In addition it is the contention that  the alleged Will of the First Plaintiff is not valid. She has not executed  the Will while in sound state of mind.  The Will has been prepared by  the  First  Defendant  with  the  assistance  of  relatives.   The  Will  is  fabricated  one.   The  second  Plaintiff  is  not  in  possession  of  the  property .  The Trial court framed necessary issues. On the side of the  Plaintiff  P.W.1 to  P.W.3 were  examined and Ex.A.1  to  Ex.A.9 were  marked.   On  the  side  of  the  Defendants,  Second  Defendant  was  examined as D.W.1 along with one Saravanakumar was examined as  http://www.judis.nic.in 4  D.W.2 and Ex.B.1  to  Ex.B.2  were  marked.   The  trial  Court  having  found that the First Plaintiff had share in the suit property, however,  disbelieved  the  Will  propounded  by the  Second Plaintiff.   The  First  Appellate Court has also ultimately dismissed the appeal.  Challenging  the same the present second appeal is filed. 3. The Appellant has raised the following substantial Questions  of Law in the Second Appeal: \"a)  Whether the  2nd Plaintif  fhas  proved  the due  execution and genuineness of the Will / Ex.A.9 particularly   when  the  second  defendant  being  a  stranger  is  debarred  from challenging the Will? b) Whether the principle of spes successionis would   operate  against  the  defendants  1  and  2  to  claim  absolute   claim over the suit property dehors the existence of the Will   Ex.P.9? c)  Whether  the  Courts  below  have  committed  an  error  in  giving  findings  regarding  the  sale  deed  dated  26.12.2001  notwithstanding  the  factum  of  family  arrangement  pleaded by the  Plaintiffs  especially  when the  sale deed dated 26.12.2001 had not been produced before the  Court?\" 4.  The counsel  appearing for  the  appellant  submit  that  the  http://www.judis.nic.in 5  First Plaintiff being the wife of Palanisamy inherited the property along  with the First Defendant. She has equal share in the suit property. The  First  Plaintiff  died  during  the  pendency  of  the  suit.  She  has  also  executed Ex.A.9 Will bequeathing her share to her daughter in law.  It  is the contention of the learned counsel, the First Defendant is acting  against the interet of the family and in the habit of selling the family  properties which was objected by his mother.  Thereby she has filed  partition suit.   The  very  conduct  of  the  mother  filing  partition  suit  against  her  son,  clearly  indicate  that  both  are  at  loggerheads.  Therefore,  as  a  sharer  she  has  bequeathed  her  share  only  in  the  interest  of  her  daughter-in-law she  is  residing away from the  First  Defendant. 5. P.W.2 and P.w.3 have clearly spoken about the execution of  the will by the First Plaintiff.  Their evidence is not even shaken in the  cross examination. Whereas the trial  Court and first appellate court  has simply disbelieved the Will on the ground that the Will has been  prepared  without  verifying the  originals.   Such  appreciation by  the  courts below is against the settled principles of law.  Hence, submitted  that the Courts below have not appreciated the facts.  He relied upon a  judgment  of  the  Honourable  Apex  Court  reported  in  Sridevi  and  http://www.judis.nic.in 6  Others v. Jayaraja Shetty and others [MANU/SC/0065/2005]  and  Madhukar  D.Shende  v.  Tarabai  Aba  Shedage  [MANU/SC/0016/2002]. 6.  Learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  respondent  would  contend that the Will propounded by the second Plaintiff is fabricated  one at the instance of the first defendant.  First Defendant is none  other than the  husband of the second plaintiff.  Only to non-suit the  sale  made  in  favour  of  the  second  defendant  the  Will  has  been  projected.  Attesting witnesses are the close relatives of the Plaintiffs  and First Defendant.  Hence, the Courts below have rightly disbelieved  the Will and submitted that the appeal has to be dismissed. 7. In the light of the above submissions when the facts are  analysed, the mother has filed a suit against his son, originally alleging  that to defraud her  share he has sold the suit  property.   The first  defendant remained exparte.  The fact remains that the property is  self-acquired property of Palanisamy, the husband of the First Plaintiff  and father  of  the First  Defendant.   Second Defendant is  also close  relative of the first Defendant.  He said to have purchased the property  on 26.12.2001.  Second Defendant did not dispute the share of  the  http://www.judis.nic.in 7  plaintiff  but  his  only  contention  is  that  the  First  Plaintiff  has  relinquished her share in favour of the First Defendant her son.  The  courts below have correctly found that the relinquishment pleaded by  the defendant has not been established and in fact the trial Court has  held that First Plaintiff  has half  share in the suit  property.  Second  Plaintiff has subsequently impleaded on the strength of Ex.A.9 Will.  It  is the case of the Second Plaintiff that the First Plaintff has left the Will  Ex.A.9  dated  2.7.2003  in  respect  her  undivided  share  in  the  suit  property in her favour.  On the strength of  Ex.A.9, second Plaintiff was  impleaded after the death of the First Plaintff.  It is also well settled,  undivided  share  can  be  bequeathed  there  is  no  bar  under  law  to  execute such a Will.  It is the only contention of the defendant that the  Will has been fabricated.  It is to be noted that the first plaintiff has  made  a  specific  allegation  against  her  son  defrauding  her  share.  Admittedly the first Plaintiff had half share in the suit property. It is  also alleged that in order to clear of the debts of the family only 23  cents agreed to be sold and in remaining property she has half-share.  The trial Court and First Appellate court have rightly held that the First  plaintiff had share in the suit property.  However, disbelieved the Will  on the ground that the Will was written without referring to the original  title deed.   http://www.judis.nic.in 8  8. P.Ws.2 and 3 were examined to prove the Will.  In their  evidence, they have categorically stated that the Will was executed by  the  testatrix  while  she  was  in  sound  state  of  mind  and  both  the  attesting  witnesses  seen  the  testatrix  executing  the  Will  in  their  presence. The testatrix also seen the attesting witnesses signed in the  Will.",

I  have  heard  Mr.C.S.Vaidyanathan,  learned  Senior  Counsel  for  the  petitioner and Mr.P.S.Raman, learned Senior Counsel for the respondent. 3. The brief facts, as pleaded in the petition, leading to the institution of the  above proceedings are as follows:- (i)  that  the  respondent,  which  was  originally  incorporated  as  a  Private  Limited Company under a different name and which later became a closely held Public  Limited Company and a wholly owned subsidiary of a listed Company, entered into 4  separate contracts, all on the same date viz., 10.5.2006 with the petitioner herein; (ii) that all the 4 contracts were towards the project of setting up a coal  based power plant of 3,600 MW Capacity; (iii) that the total contract price of all the 4 contracts dated 10.5.2006 was  fixed at USD 943,978,215.00 and INR 15,602,886,878.00; (iv) that as per the terms and conditions of the contracts, the petitioner not  only started executing works, but also issued Performance Bank Guarantees to the  total tune of USD 123,599,998.10, all of which are valid and subsisting till 31.10.2013; (v) that the petitioner completed all its obligations under all the 4 contracts  and all the 4 Units (4 x 600 MW), were set up except that the Reliability Run and  Performance Guarantee Test for Unit No.4 was pending; (vi)  that  all  the  4  Units  are  complete  in  all  respects  and  are  already  operating commercially and generating revenue, with the respondent selling power  from all the 4 Units to various Government and Non-Governmental Agencies; 3 (vii) that despite the petitioner fulfilling and performing all their obligations,  the respondent delayed payment of even the admitted milestone payments, especially  after 2010; (viii) that in several letters, the respondent duly admitted its default as well  as the delay in the release of the outstanding payments; (ix) that when a staggering amount of USD 115.03 million and INR 140.95  crores was omitted to be paid by the respondent, the petitioner issued a notice of  suspension of work on 18.4.2012; (x)  that  immediately  the  respondent  sent   a  reply,  giving  a  payment  schedule, thereby admitting the liability; (xi)  that  even  by  a  subsequent  mail  dated  20.4.2012,  the  respondent's  Director admitted and acknowledged the liability to the tune of USD 107 million and  INR 140 crores; (xii) that even while admitting and acknowledging liability under the letter  dated 20.4.2012, the respondent simultaneously issued notices on the same date,  viz., 20.4.2012 to the Bankers to invoke the Performance Bank Guarantees; (xiii) that therefore, the petitioner was constrained to move applications in  Arbitration Petition Nos.590-593 of 2012 on the file of the High Court of Judicature at  Bombay under Section 9 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, challenging the  invocation of the Performance Bank Guarantees; (xiv) that the prayer of the petitioner in those applications for the grant of  an ex parte order of interim injunction was rejected by a single Judge of the Bombay  High Court on 23.4.2012; (xv) that the petitioner then moved appeals before the Division Bench and  obtained interim prohibitory orders restraining the Banks from making payment to the  4 respondent in pursuance of the invocation of Guarantee; (xvi)  that  immediately  thereafter,  the  respondent  issued  a  letter  dated  24.4.2012, revoking the letter invoking Bank Guarantees; (xvii) that consequently, the parties reached a settlement, leading to the  disposal of the appeals by the Division Bench, in terms of the consent between the  parties; (xviii) that thereafter the petitioner as well as the respondent nominated the  Arbitrators to resolve the disputes; (xix)  that  after  the  parties  nominated  the  Arbitrators,  but  before  the  Arbitrators could choose an umpire, the parties resolved the dispute amicably in a  meeting held on 10.7.2012; (xx)  that  in  the  Minutes  of  the  meeting  recorded  on  10.7.2012,  the  respondent agreed to a schedule of payment, under which the respondent was to pay  a sum of Rs.175 crores on or before 15.7.2012, a sum of Rs.50 crores on or before  15.8.2012, a sum of Rs.125 crores on or before 15.9.2012 and a sum of Rs.125 crores  on or before 15.10.2012; (xxi) that after making payment of only a sum of Rs.100 crores, out of the  total payment agreed to be made viz., Rs.475 crores, the respondent failed to make  any further payment; (xxii) that the respondent thus defaulted in making payment of even the  amount  admitted  and  acknowledged  under  the  Minutes  of  the  meeting  dated  10.7.2012; (xxiii) that when the petitioner issued a letter dated 6.8.2012, demanding  payment, the respondent started making all kinds of objections; (xxiv)  that  in  the  meantime,  it  came to  be  known that  the  respondent  5 initiated a process of merger and amalgamation with Sesa Goa Limited; (xxv)  that  upon  coming  to  know  of  the  petition  of  the  respondent  for  approving a Scheme of Amalgamation pending in this Court in C.P.No.166 of 2012, the  petitioner filed objections on 24.9.2012, on the ground that the petitioner is one of the  largest unsecured creditor of the Company, whose interest will be jeopardised if the  Scheme was sanctioned; (xxvi) that the financial position of the respondent is highly leveraged, as  seen from its statements of financial affairs; (xxvii) that even as per the Annual Report for the financial year 2011-2012,  the respondent-Company had utilised funds aggregating to Rs.6,421.95 crores raised  on short term basis for long term investment; (xxviii) that the short term borrowings of the respondent have increased  from Rs.4,814.35 crores as on 31.3.2011 to Rs.6,905.77 crores as on 31.3.2012; (xxix)  that  therefore  the  petitioner  issued  a  statutory  notice  dated  1.11.2012 under Sections 433 and 434; (xxx)  that  the  respondent  gave  a  reply  on  5.11.2012  raising  frivolous  objections; (xxxi)  that  since  the  respondent-Company  appears  to  be  in  insolvent  circumstances,  it  is  just,  equitable  and  necessary  that  the  respondent-Company  should be wound up. 4.  The  respondent  has  filed  a  counter  to  the  main  Company  Petition  contending inter alia:- (i)  that  as  against  the  total  value  of  all  the  contracts  dated  10.5.2006,  working out to Rs.6,563/- crores, the respondent has already made payment of a sum  of Rs.5,867/- crores to the petitioner; 6 (ii) that the non-payment of the amount fixed in the Minutes of the meeting  dated 10.7.2012 was on account of disputes on performance; (iii) that the contracts between the parties have an arbitration clause, in  pursuance  of  which  the  petitioner  already  invoked  arbitration  and  moved  an  application under Section 9 before the Bombay High Court; (iv) that those proceedings were withdrawn after the signing of the Minutes  of the meeting dated 10.7.2012; (v) that therefore if the obligations under the Minutes of the meeting have  not been complied with, the remedy of the petitioner lies only before the Court in  which they moved an application under Section 9; (vi) that the amount of Rs.5,867/- crores paid by the respondent includes  an amount of Rs.525/- crores paid in 2011-2012 and an amount of Rs.380/- crores  paid in 2012-2013 and hence the petition for winding up is an abuse of the process of  law; (vii) that there is no admitted or acknowledged debt or liability; (viii)  that in the Minutes of the meeting dated 10.7.2012, a schedule of  payment was fixed contingent upon the petitioner following a schedule of work set out  in Clause 2(b) to Clause 2(g)",

By  G.O.Ms.No.184,  Labour  and  Employment  Department,  dated  29.12.2009 published in the Tamil Nadu Government  Gazette  dated 3.2.2010,  the  State Government published the draft of an amendment to the Tamil Nadu Factories  Rules, 1950, proposed to be made in exercise of the powers conferred by Sections 87  and 112 of  the Factories Act,  1948. Persons who are likely to be affected by the  proposed amendments, were invited to lodge their objections within a period of 45  days, to the proposal. It appears that the petitioner-Association filed its objections to  the  Principal  Secretary  to  Government,  Labour  and  Employment  Department,  on  10.3.2010. 5. After more than about 1-1/2 yers, the Government issued the impugned  order  G.O.Ms.No.70,  dated 26.8.2011 and published the same in the Government  Gazette  on  9.11.2011.  Aggrieved  by  the  amendments  so  made,  the  petitioner  is  before this Court. 3 6. Before considering the objections of the petitioner to the amendments, it  is necessary to take note of a few facts and the nature of the amendments made.  They are as follows:- (i)  Rule  95  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Factories  Rules,  1950,  lists  out,  certain  operations to be declared as dangerous operations, when carried on in a factory. The  list  comprises  of  32  types  of  operations.  \"Fireworks  Manufactories  and  Match  Factories\" is listed at Serial No.24 of the said list under Rule 95(1). (ii) About 32 Schedules are annexed to Rule 95. Each of those Schedules  are relatable to one of the items listed as dangerous operations under Rule 95 (1). (iii) Since fireworks manufactories and match factories are listed at Serial  No.24 under Rule 95(1), Schedule XXIV contains the prescriptions relating to these  types of factories. The prescriptions are categorised under 13 paragraphs in Schedule  XXIV. Paragraph-10 of Schedule XXIV contains 12 prescriptions. (iv) By the impugned amendment, 17 more prescriptions are sought to be  inserted in paragraph 10 of Schedule XXIV and this is what the petitioner is aggrieved  against. 7. The existing 12 prescriptions under paragraph 10 of Schedule XXIV are  assigned numbers from item No.(a) to (l). By the impugned amendment, 17 items are  sought to be inserted, as item Nos.(m) to (z) and (aa), (ab) and (ac). 8. Fortunately, the learned counsel for the petitioner submitted, at the time  of  hearing,  that  the  petitioner  is  not  opposing  all  the  17  items  inserted  by  the  impugned amendment. The opposition of the petitioner is only to a few of those 17  items now inserted by the impugned amendments. 9. In particular, the opposition of  the petitioner is to the items inserted  under the alphabets (n), (p), (q), (r), (s), (t), (u), (v) and (ac). It may be useful to  4 extract these items to which the petitioner has objections, since the objection of the  petitioner revolves around certain factual issues also. Therefore, the items for which  the petitioner has objections are listed as follows:- \"(n)  Workers  aged  above  55  years  shall  be  employed only in non-explosive areas. (p) Work benches and tables shall be provided for   mixing and filling operations. (q) Blast walls shall be provided around the drying  platform at a distance of two metres away from the drying  platform. The height of the blast wall shall be at least one  foot more than that of the height of the drying platform. (r)  In  every  Fireworks  Factory,  there  shall  be  appointed a Supervisor with minimum qualification of B.Sc.,  (Chemistry)  or  Diploma  in  Chemical  Engineering  or  its   equivalent. He shall be fully conversant with the process of   manufacture of fireworks and the associated hazards. These  Supervisors shall undergo special training of fireworks safety  as approved by the Chief Inspector of Factories. Number of   Supervisors  shall  be  at  the  rate  of  one  for  every  fifty  workers. Manufacture of fireworks shall be carried out under  the supervision of such Supervisors. (s)  Factories  which  make  fancy  crackers  shall  have.-- (i) separate colour pellet machine shed; (ii) separate colour pellet drying shed; and (iii)  separate  transit  room  for  storing  colour  pellets. (t)  Not more  than one manufacturing activity  of  any one item of crackers shall be allowed or required to be  done in any working shed at a time. (u)  The  workers  involved  in  mixing  and  filling  operations shall have an educational qualification of at least   Higher Secondary Course. 5 (v)  The  drying  platform  meant  for  Rockets  and  Fire  Works  of  flying  nature  shall  be  provided  with  a  temporary roof of a strong aluminium mesh cover resting on  the baffle walls, for protection from direct sunlight. (ac) No manufacturing activity shall be carried on  in Fireworks factory between 6.00 p.m., and 6.00 a.m.\" 10.  The  grounds  on  which  the  petitioner  challenges  the  impugned  amendments can be briefly summarised as follows:- (i) that there is repugnancy between the requirements now prescribed by  the impugned amendment and the requirements prescribed by the Explosives Rules  2008; (ii) that the State Government had already issued a notification categorising  the fireworks manufactories as hazardous industry, thereby shifting these industries  from the category of \"dangerous operations\" in terms of Section 87 of the Factories  Act, 1948 and hence the prescriptions introduced under Rule 95, cannot be applied to  them; (iii)  that  the  Department  of  Explosives  has  Experts  and  hence  their  competence to stipulate standards is much higher than that of  the officials of  the  Labour Department, who are only generalists and not specialists; (iv)  The  impugned  amendment  has  not  been  laid  before  the  State  Legislature as mandated by Section 115 of the Factories Act, 1948; and (v) that under Section 5 of the Explosives Act, 1884, the rule making power  vests  only  with  the  Central  Government  and hence  the  State  Government  is  not  competent to lay the Rules. Now I shall consider these contentions one after another. (I) REPUGNANCY: 11. The Explosives Act, 1884 is a colonial legislation. After the enactment of  6 the Constitution, explosives was included along with arms, firearm and ammunition  under Entry-5 in list-I (Union List). The Act was adopted by the independent India. 12. Similarly, the Factories Act, 1948 is also an Act that came into force  before  the  adoption  of  the  Constitution.  In  the  Constitution,  \"Welfare  of  Labour  including  conditions  of  work,  Provident  Funds,  Employers  liability,  Workmen's  Compensation, Invalidity and Old-age Pensions and Maternity benefits\" were included  at Entry No.24 of List-III (Concurrent List). Similarly, Factories was included as Entry  No.36 of List III of the VII Schedule.",

            "content":"1 IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUDICATURE AT MADRAS Dated :  25-03-2013 Coram : The Honourable Mr.Justice V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN Writ Petition No.7424 of 2013 And M.P.Nos.1 & 2 of 2013 V.Srinivasan ...Petitioner  Vs 1.The Secretary,     Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution        Corporation Ltd.,    Chennai-2. 2.The Chairman cum Managing Director,    Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution        Corporation Ltd.,    Chennai-2. 3.The Secretary,    TANTRANSCO,    Chennai-2. 4.The Chairman cum Director,    TANTRANSCO,    Chennai-2. ...Respondents PETITION under Article 226 of  the Constitution of  India,  praying for the  issue of a Writ of Certiorari,  to call for the records relating to Memorandum (Per)  No.35421/A18/A181/2012-I  dated  19.6.2012  issued  by  the  first  respondent  and  quash the same. For Petitioner      : Mr.Abudu Kumar Rajaratnam O R D E R The petitioner  has come up with the above writ  petition, challenging an  2 Office Memorandum issued by the Secretariat Branch of the Tamil Nadu Generation  and Distribution Corporation Limited, clarifying that the Officials of the Corporation,  come  within  the  purview  of  the  term  'public  servant'  under  the  Prevention  of  Corruption Act, 1988 and that therefore, whenever sanction is sought for prosecution,  the same shall be granted without delay. 2. Heard Mr.Abudu Kumar Rajaratnam, learned counsel for the petitioner. 3. By the Memorandum impugned in this writ petition dated 19.6.2012, the  Secretariat Branch of the TANGEDCO, considered a vexed question as to whether the  Officials of the Corporations continue to be public servants, even after the coming into  the force of the Electricity Act, 2003 or not. The Secretariat Branch of the Corporation  took an affirmative view that in view of the definition of the expression contained in  the  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988,  their  employees,  who  were  earlier  the  employees of the Electricity Board, are actually public servants. Aggrieved by the said  clarification issued by way of  a Memorandum dated 19.6.2012,  the petitioner  has  come up with the above writ petition. 4.  Mr.Abudu  Kumar  Rajaratnam,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  contended  that  under  Section  81  of  the  Electricity  (Supply)  Act,  1948,  all  the  Members, Officers and other employees of the Electricity Board were deemed, when  acting or purporting to act in pursuance of any of the provisions of the Act, to be  public servants within the meaning of Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code. But the  Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948, was repealed by the Electricity Act, 2003. Section 185  of the Electricity Act, 2003 specifically repealed the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948 as  well as the provisions of the Indian Electricity Act, 1910 and the Electricity Regulatory  Commission Act, 1998. The Electricity Act, 2003 does not contain any provision, which  is exactly the same as that of Section 81 of the Electricity (Supply) Act, 1948. On the  3 contrary, it contains a provision in Section 169, whereby the Chairperson, Members,  Officers and other employees of the Appellate Tribunal and the Chairperson, Members,  Secretary,  Officers  and  other  employees  of  the  Appropriate  Commission  and  the  Assessing  Officer  referred  to  in  Section  126,  shall  be  deemed,  when  acting  or  purporting  to  act  in  pursuance  of  any  of  the  provisions  of  this  Act,  to  be  public  servants within the meaning of Section 21 of the Indian Penal Code. 5. Therefore, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is that  while Section 81 of the 1948 Act covered all servants and employees of the Electricity  Board, Section 169 of the 2003 Act restricted the application of the expression 'public  servant' only to a few categories of employees, after the bifurcation of the erstwhile  Board. In such circumstances, it is contended by the learned counsel for the petitioner  that  the  impugned  Memorandum  making  all  employees  of  the  newly  formed  Corporations  'public  servants'  amounted  to  executive  legislation  overreaching  the  specific statutory provisions. 6. In order to test the veracity of the above contention, I may have to take  note of various provisions of four Enactments, namely The Indian Penal Code, The  Electricity  (Supply)  Act,  1948,  The  Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988,  and  The  Electricity Act, 2003. 7.  Section  21  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  defines  the  expression  'public  servant' as follows: \"Public servant\".-- The words \"public servant\" denote a person falling  under any of the descriptions hereinafter following, namely:--  Second.--  Every  Commissioned  Officer  in  the  Military,  Naval  or  Air  Forces of India;  Third.--  Every  Judge  including  any  person  empowered  by  law  to  discharge, whether by himself or as a member of any body of persons,   any adjudicatory functions;  4 Fourth.-- Every officer  of  a Court of Justice 6 (including a liquidator,   receiver  or  commissioner)  whose  duty  it  is,  as  such  officer,  to  investigate  or  report  on  any  matter  of  law  or  fact,  or  to  make,   authenticate, or keep any document, or to take charge or dispose of any  property, or to execute any judicial process, or to administer any oath,   or  to  interpret,  or  to  preserve  order  in  the Court,  and every  person   specially authorized by a Court of Justice to perform any of such duties;  Fifth.-- Every juryman, assessor, or member of a panchayat assisting a  Court of Justice or public servant;  Sixth.-- Every arbitrator or other person to whom any cause or matter  has been referred for decision or report by any Court of Justice, or by  any  other  competent  public  authority;  Seventh.--  Every  person  who  holds any office by virtue of which he is empowered to place or keep any   person in confinement;  Eighth.--  Every  officer  of  the  Government  whose  duty  it  is,  as  such  officer,  to prevent  offences,  to give information of  offences,  to bring  offenders  to  justice,  or  to  protect  the  public  health,  safety  or   convenience;  Ninth.-- Every officer whose duty it is as such officer, to take, receive,   keep or expend any property on behalf of the Government, or to make  any survey, assessment or contract on behalf of the Government, or to  execute any revenue- process, or to investigate, or to report, on any  matter affecting the pecuniary interests of the Government, or to make,  authenticate, or keep any document relating to the pecuniary interests   of  the  Government,  or  to  prevent  the  infraction  of  any  law  for  the  protection of the pecuniary interests of the Government;  Tenth.-- Every officer whose duty it is, as such officer, to take, receive,   keep or expend any property, to make any survey or assessment or to   levy any rate or tax for any secular common purpose of any village,   town or district, or to make, authenticate or keep any document for the   ascertaining of the rights of the people of any village, town or district; Eleventh.-- Every person who holds any office in virtue of which he is   empowered to prepare, publish, maintain or revise an electoral roll or to  conduct an election or part of an election; 5 Twelfth.-- Every person-- (a)in the service or pay of the Government or remunerated by fees or  commission for the performance of any public duty by the Government; (b)in the service or pay of a local authority, a corporation established by  or under a Central, Provincial or State Act or a Government company as  defined in section 617 of the Companies Act, 1956 (1 of 1956 ). Illustration A Municipal  Commissioner is a public servant.  Explanation  1.--  Persons  falling  under  any  of  the  above  descriptions  are  public   servants, whether appointed by the Government or not. Explanation 2.-- Wherever the words\" public servant\" occur, they shall  be  understood  of  every  person  who  is  in  actual  possession  of  the  situation of a public servant, whatever legal defect there may be in his   right to hold that situation. Explanation 3.-- The word \"election\" denotes   an  election  for  the  purpose  of  selecting  members  of  any  legislative,  municipal or other public authority, of whatever character, the method  of selection to which is by, or under, any law prescribed as by election.\"  8. The above definition was very comprehensive and was in great detail, in  view of  the  fact  that  the  Indian  Penal  Code itself,  as  it  originally  was,  contained  provisions, for dealing with offences relating to corruption. Sections 161 to 165-A of  the Indian Penal Code, as they originally stood, dealt with (i) the offence of a public  servant taking gratification (ii) the offence of taking gratification in order to influence  public servant by corrupt or illegal means (iii) the offence of taking gratification for the  exercise  of  or  personal  influence  with  public  servants  and  (iv)  punishments  for  abetment of such offences, etc.",

Lee Chengavaraya Naickker Maligai    Anna Salai    Chennai-2. 3.The Superintendent of Police    Cuddalore District.      ...Respondents PETITION under Article 226 of The Constitution of India praying for the  issuance of a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records of the  third respondent in his impugned proceedings in Na.Ka.No.A4/35540/ 2012  dated 24.12.2012, quash the same and consequently direct the respondents  herein to appoint the petitioner herein for the post of Police Constable Grade  II.  For Petitioner  : Mr.D.Ravichander For Respondents    : Mr.V.Subbiah    Spl. Govt. Pleader ------ 2   ORDER The petitioner applied for appointment to the post of Police Constable  Grade II.  His application was rejected by the order impugned in the writ  petition on two grounds viz., (i) that he was implicated in a criminal case and  (ii) that he had suppressed the said fact in his application form. Therefore he  has come up with the above writ petition, challenging the order. 2.  Heard  Mr.D.  Ravichander,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner.  Mr.V.Subbiah,  learned  Special  Government  Pleader  takes  notice  for  the  respondents. 3. The Special Rules for Tamil Nadu Police Subordinate Services were  amended and an explanation was inserted under Rule 14(b)(iv).  The validity  of the said amendment came up for consideration before a Full Bench of this  Court  in  Manikandan  and  others  Vs.  The  Chairman,  Tamilnadu  Uniformed Services Recruitment Board, Chennai {2008 (2) CTC 97}.  The amendment was upheld by the Full Bench, to which I was a party. 4. In the case on hand, the petitioner does not dispute the fact that he  was implicated as an accused in a complaint in Crime No.606 of 2009 for the  alleged offences under Sections 147, 148, 294(b), 324, 323, 336 and 307  I.P.C.  It appears that he was subsequently acquitted by  judgment dated  23.6.2010 by the II Additional Sessions Judge, Cuddalore,  in S.C.No.41 of  3 2010. 5.  But  unfortunately,  the  petitioner  had  admittedly  suppressed  the  factum of  facing  criminal  prosecution  in  his  application  submitted  to  the  Uniformed  Services  Recruitment  Board.  Therefore,  the  rejection  of  the  candidature on the ground of suppression of material facts, cannot be said to  be illegal.  The explanation inserted under Rule 14(b) having been upheld by  the Full Bench of this Court, it is no more open to the petitioner to contend  that he has been acquitted. 6. The learned counsel for the petitioner relied upon a recent decision  of the Supreme Court in  Jainendra Singh v. State of U.P., (2012) 8 SCC  748.  Before considering the purport of the same, it should be pointed out  that the same is not a final adjudication or a final opinion. It is actually a  reference made by a Two Member Bench of the Supreme Court to a Larger  Bench for considering certain questions. 7. The cardinal principles which the Supreme Court had summarised in  paragraph 29 of the said decision are as follows: \"29. As noted by us, all the above decisions  were  rendered  by  a  Division  Bench  of  this  Court  consisting of two Judges and having bestowed our  4 serious consideration to the issue, we consider that  while dealing with such an issue, the Court will have  to  bear  in  mind  the  various  cardinal  principles  before granting any relief  to  the aggrieved party,  namely: 29.1. Fraudulently obtained orders  of  appointment  could  be  legitimately  treated as voidable at the option of the  employer  or  could  be  recalled  by  the  employer  and  in  such  cases  merely  because  the  respondent  employee  has  continued  in  service  for  a  number  of  years, on the basis of such fraudulently  obtained  employment,  cannot  get  any  equity  in  his  favour  or  any  estoppel  against the employer. 29.2. Verification of the character  and antecedents is one of the important  criteria  to  test  whether  the  selected  candidate  is  suitable  to  the  post  under  the  State  and  on  account  of  his  antecedents  the  appointing  authority  if  finds it not desirable to appoint a person  to a disciplined force can it be said to be  unwarranted. 29.3. When  appointment  was  procured  by  a  person  on  the  basis  of  forged  documents,  it  would  amount  to  misrepresentation  and  fraud  on  the  employer and, therefore, it would create  5 no equity in his  favour or  any estoppel  against  the  employer  while  resorting  to  termination without holding any inquiry. 29.4. A  candidate  having  suppressed  material  information  and/or  giving  false  information  cannot  claim  right  to  continue  in  service  and  the  employer, having regard to the nature of  employment as well as other aspects, has  the discretion to terminate his services. 29.5. The  purpose  of  calling  for  information regarding involvement in any  criminal case or detention or conviction is  for  the  purpose  of  verification  of  the  character/  antecedents  at  the  time  of  recruitment  and  suppression  of  such  material  information  will  have  a  clear  bearing on the character and antecedents  of  the  candidate  in  relation  to  his  continuity in service. 29.6. The person who suppressed  the  material  information  and/or  gives  false information cannot claim any right  for appointment or continuity in service. 29.7. The standard expected of a  person  intended  to  serve  in  uniformed  service  is  quite  distinct  from  other  services  and,  therefore,  any  deliberate  statement  or  omission regarding a  vital  information can be seriously viewed and  6 the  ultimate  decision  of  the  appointing  authority cannot be faulted. 29.8. An  employee  on  probation  can be discharged from service  or  may  be refused employment on the ground of  suppression  of  material  information  or  making  false  statement  relating  to  his  involvement  in  the  criminal  case,  conviction or detention, even if ultimately  he  was  acquitted  of  the  said  case,  inasmuch as such a situation would make  a person undesirable or unsuitable for the  post. 29.9.  An  employee  in  the  uniformed service  presupposes  a higher  level  of  integrity  as  such  a  person  is  expected to uphold the law and on the  contrary such a service born in deceit and  subterfuge cannot be tolerated. 29.10. The  authorities  entrusted  with  the  responsibility  of  appointing  constables, are under duty to verify the  antecedents  of  a  candidate  to  find  out  whether he is suitable for the post of a  constable  and so long as  the candidate  has  not  been  acquitted  in  the  criminal  case, he cannot be held to be suitable for  appointment to the post of constable.\" 8. A careful  reading of  the above reference made by the Supreme  7 Court  to a Large Bench, would show that the said case arose out of  the  attempted cancellation of an appointment already made.  In the case before  the Supreme Court, the petitioner was selected and was actually sent for  training.  Subsequently, upon coming to know of his involvement in a criminal  case,  the  Senior  Superintendent  of  Police  passed  orders  terminating  the  appointment.  Therefore,  there  is  a   fine  spun  distinction  between  the  reference pending before the Larger Bench of the Supreme Court and cases  of this nature. 9. In cases of the present nature, no orders of appointment have so  far been issued. The candidature of the petitioner has been rejected at the  threshold. The petitioner was not even appointed nor sent for training. It  should  be  pointed  out  that  as  per  paragraph 29  of  the  reference  of  the  Supreme Court extracted above, even in cases where orders of appointment  had  been  issued,  they  become  voidable  for  suppression  of  material  particulars. Therefore, when there was not even an order of appointment, the  decision taken by the employer not to appoint such persons at all, cannot be  questioned on the basis of the reference pending  before the Larger Bench of the Supreme Court.  It is needless to point out  that efficiency and integrity of the police force comes under scanner as well  as under attack many a times both socially and in Courts of law.  Therefore,  if  the  Government  thinks  fit  to  keep the  process  of  selection  completely  sterilised so as  to keep away persons who were involved in criminal cases, it  8 is not for this Court to say that the same is wrong.  Persons who are already  issued with orders of appointment, stand on a different footing than those  who have not been appointed.  The former acquire a vested right while the  latter would not. Therefore, the reference pending before the larger Bench of  the Supreme Court would not help the petitioner. Hence, this writ petition is  dismissed. Consequently, the connected MP is closed.

Respondents Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, praying for the  issue  of  a  Writ  of  Certiorari,  calling  for  records  of  the  Government  Letter(s)/G.O.Ms.No.127  dated  2.6.2010  of  the  Higher  Education  (B1)  Department  passed by the first respondent and quash the same as unconstitutional and ultra vires of  the Constitution. For Petitioner :   Mr.P.T.Perumal For Respondents :   Mr.N.Srinivasan,     Additional Government Pleader. O R D E R The  petitioner  has  come  up  with  the  above  writ  petition,  challenging  a  communication  issued  by  the  Principal  Secretary  to  Government,  Higher  Education,  Department addressed to the Tamil Nadu State Women's Commission, refusing to grant  maternity leave to girl students undergoing higher education in the State. 2.  I  have  heard  Mr.P.T.Perumal,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  Mr.N.Srinivasan, learned Additional Government Pleader for respondents. 3.  The  petitioner  completed  a  B.Sc.,  degree  in  Chemistry  from  the  Madras  University. After graduation, she got married and thereafter she studied Master's degree  in Social Work from the Madras University. Subsequently, the petitioner joined a 3 year  Diploma  Course  in  Direction  and  Screen  Play  Writing  in  the  Tamil  Nadu  Dr.  MGR  Government Film and Television Institute in the academic year 2004-2005. 4.  While  undergoing  the  second  year  of  the  course  of  study,  the  petitioner  conceived and was compelled to go on leave. Since the petitioner fell short of attendance,  she was not permitted by the institute to appear for the second year examination. 3 5. The petitioner filed writ petitions, both for permission to write the second year  examination and for permission to continue her course of study in the third year. The writ  petitions were dismissed and the writ appeals filed by the petitioner were also dismissed,  after finding that she did not have adequate attendance. 6. Thereafter the petitioner obtained some information regarding her attendance  and filed a review application. But the review application was dismissed and the Supreme  Court appears to have ordered notice in the Special Leave Petitions arising out of the  same. 7. In the meantime, the petitioner submitted a representation to the Tamil Nadu  State Women's Commission, highlighting the plight of the women students like her and  the treatment meted out to them. It appears that the Women's Commission took up the  issue with various Departments. In response to the recommendations of the Women's  Commission, the Principal Secretary to Government, Higher Education Department has  sent a communication which is impugned in the writ petition. By the said communication,  the first respondent has taken a stand that no maternity leave can be allowed to students  undergoing  higher  education  in  Government  and  Government  Aided  Institutions.  Therefore, though the petitioner herself may not stand to benefit personally from the  outcome of this writ petition, the petitioner has come up with a challenge to the said  communication, in the larger interest of  girl students who happen to marry and who  happen to conceive while still undergoing higher education. 8. The impugned order cites two reasons. They are (i) women students undergoing  degree courses may invariably be less than 21 years of  age and hence the grant of  maternity benefit may be seen as an incentive to girls getting married before completing  21 years of age and (ii) women students, who absent themselves due to confinement,  4 are given the facility of undergoing the course of study once again in the next academic  year and hence there is no necessity to give the benefit of maternity leave to these  students. 9. The seventh respondent has filed a counter affidavit, both on his behalf and on  behalf of the second respondent. The second and seventh respondents are actually in  administrative control of the Tamil Nadu Film and Television Institute. They are not the  persons who have passed the impugned order. Therefore, the focus of the counter filed  by respondents 2 and 7 is only limited to the lack of attendance of the petitioner and her  failure  to fulfill the criteria for being permitted to take the examination. In other words,  the counter  filed by the respondents  2 and 7 merely proceed  on the basis  that  the  petitioner  is  not  entitled to the relief  of  condonation of  lack of  attendance or  to the  benefit of maternity leave. 10. But, in the case on hand, the petitioner is not seeking any relief for herself. It  is admitted by the petitioner that her fate is already sealed by the orders passed in her  writ  petition  and  writ  appeal.  She  has  now  challenged  only  the  order  of  the  first  respondent  passed in response to a recommendation made by the Tamil Nadu State  Women's Commission. What is canvassed in the present writ petition is only a question of  larger public interest for the grant of maternity leave to women students undergoing  higher education in the State of Tamil Nadu. Therefore, the counter filed by respondents  2 and 7 is of no value to the issue raised in the writ petition. 11. Mr.P.T.Perumal, learned counsel for the petitioner has filed a set of documents  to show that there are educational  institutions which either  grant maternity leave or  grant  condonation  of  lack  of  attendance  during  the  period  of  confinement.  These  documents, in brief, point out the following: 5 (i)  An  official  communication  bearing  No.PIO/RTI-A/C&R  III/2006/303  dated  13.11.2006, issued by the University of Madras shows that though the students of the  Madras  University  are  not  entitled  to  maternity  leave,  there  is  another  rule  for  the  condonation of shortage of attendance for married women students. The rule reads as  follows: \"In respect of married women students undergoing UG/PG courses,  the  minimum  attendance  for  condonation  (Theory/Practical)  shall  be  relaxed and prescribed as 55% instead of 65% if they conceive during  their academic career. Medical certificate from the Doctor attached to the  Govt.  Hospital  (D.G.O.) and  the  prescribed  fee  of  Rs.250/-  therefor  together with the attendance details shall be forwarded to the University,  to  consider  the  condonation  of  attendance  for  the  married  women  students.\" (ii) The \"Leave Rules for Students\" issued by the Office of the Dean of Academic  Affairs, IIT Kanpur, under Section 5 of the PG Manual shows that under paragraph 5.3, a  female student may be granted maternity leave for a maximum of 3 months and that  leave up to six weeks can also be granted for miscarriage including medical termination  of pregnancy. It also states that such leave can be combined with any other leave due  and will not entail any loss of financial assistantship. (iii) The Postgraduate Manual - Guidelines and Regulations issued by the Indian  Institute of Science Education and Research, Bhopal, shows that under paragraph 6.3  thereof, a female student can be granted maternity leave for a maximum period of three  months  and that  leave  up  to  six  weeks  can also  be  granted  in  case  of  miscarriage  including medical termination of pregnancy. This rule also states that there will be no loss  of financial assistantship for students on maternity leave. (iv) The copies of the relevant pages of the note file obtained by the petitioner  under the Right to Information Act shows that on the claim made by the petitioner for the  6 grant of condonation of shortage of attendance and on the recommendation made by the  Tamil Nadu State Women's Commission, a note was circulated among the departments of  (a) Law, (b) Tamil Development Culture and Religious Endowment, (c) Social Welfare and  (d) School Education, so as to ascertain their views. The Higher Education Department  appears to have recorded an opinion that the recommendation of the Tamil Nadu State  Women's Commission could be accepted and necessary amendment be brought to the  Rules. Similarly, the Tamil Development Culture and Religious Endowment Department  also appears to have accepted the recommendation of the Tamil Nadu State Women's  Commission. The Social Welfare Department has also recorded similar views. 12.  Despite  all  the  above,  the  first  respondent  has  eventually  rejected  the  representation of the Tamil Nadu State Women's Commission, on the two grounds which  I have already extracted above. 13. In addition to the information obtained from the University of Madras and IIT  Kanpur  and Indian Institute  of  Science  Education and Research,  Bhopal,  the  learned  counsel for the petitioner also relies upon the following: (i) Some Articles of the Convention on the Elimination of Discrimination Against  Women, adopted by the United Nations; (ii)  the  decision  of  the  Supreme  Court  in  Vishaka  v.  State  of  Rajasthan  ((1997) 6 SCC 241); (iii) the decision of the Supreme Court in  Municipal Corporation of Delhi ",

For Petitioner : Mr.P.H.Aravind Pandian, AAG For Respondent : Mr.N.Muralikumaran O R D E R The Anna University has come up with the above writ petition challenging a  communication sent by the Council of Architecture, informing them of the decision of  the Executive Committee of the Council,  to reduce the permitted annual intake of  students from 80 to 40 from the academic years 2012-2013 for a period of five years,  on the ground that there were some deficiencies.  2.  I  have  heard  Mr.P.H.Aravindh  Pandian,  learned  Additional  Advocate  General  appearing  for  the  petitioner  and  Mr.N.Muralikumaran,  learned  counsel  appearing for the respondent herein.  3. The Department of Architecture, was originally started as a constituent of  2 the Guindy Engineering College, affiliated to the Madras University way back in the  year 1957. After the issue of the Anna University Act, 1978, it became a unit of the  Anna University. It was a pioneer in the field of education in Architecture and Planning.  4.  But,  even  before  the  Anna  University  was  carved  out  of  the  Madras  University, the Parliament enacted the Architects Act, 1972 and it came into force on  1.9.1972.  The  Act  provided for  the  constitution  of  a  council  known as  Council  of  Architecture. The Council of Architecture was entrusted by Section 21 of the Act to  prescribe  the  minimum standards  of  architectural  education  required  for  granting  recognised qualifications by colleges and institutions in India. 5. While Section 44 empowered the Central Government to make rules with  respect to the matters enumerated in Sub-Section (2) thereof, Section 45 empowered  the Council of Architecture itself to make regulations. The regulations so framed by  the Council, may provide for  (i)  the  courses  and  periods  of  study  and  of  practical  training  to  be  undertaken, the subject of examinations and standards of proficiency therein obtained  in college or institution for grant of recognised qualifications;  (ii) the standards of staff, equipment, accommodation, training and other  facilities for architectural education; and (iii)  the conduct of professional examinations, qualifications of  examiners  and conditions of admission to such examinations.  6.  In  exercise  of  the  power  conferred  by  Section  45,  the  Council  of  Architecture  issued a set of regulations known as Council of Architecture (Minimum  Standards of Architectural Education) Regulations, 1983. It appears from the web site  of  the  Council  of  Architecture  that  there  are  280  institutions,  which  impart  architectural education in India leading to recognised qualifications. The standards of  3 education  imparted in  these  institutions,  whether  they  are  constituent  colleges  or  departments of universities or deemed universities or affiliated colleges/schools or IITs  or NITs or autonomous institutions, are governed by these regulations issued in 1983.  These  regulations  set  forth  the  requirement  of  eligibility  for  admission,  course  duration, standards of staff  and accommodation, course content, examination, etc.  The  Council  of  Architecture  oversees  maintenance  of  standards  periodically  by  conducting inspections through committees of experts.  7. It appears that the annual permitted intake allowed by the Council of  Architecture  for  the  School  of  Architecture  and  Planning  of  the  Anna  University  originally stood at 40 and the same was enhanced to 60 in the year 2009-10. The  intake was further enhanced from 60 to 80 from the academic year 2010-11. It is  needless  to  mention  that  such  enhancement  of  the  annual  permitted  intake  was  allowed on the basis of an inspection and a comprehensive evaluation conducted by a  Committee of Experts.  8. But unfortunately, 14 students were admitted during the year 2010-2011  over and above the permitted intake of 80 and hence, the Council of Architecture  sought clarifications from the petitioner university. The Vice Chancellor informed the  respondent of the circumstances under which excess admission was made. In the light  of the admission of students in excess of the permitted intake, the university also  requested the respondent to conduct an inspection and evaluate the availability of  adequate infrastructure for an intake of 100.  9. By proceedings dated 22.9.2011, the respondent appointed a Committee  of two Experts to inspect the School of Architecture and Planning, on the basis of a  complaint sent by one P.R.Prabu, an Architect by himself alleging certain deficiencies.  The task assigned to the Committee  was to  report  on the alleged violations.  The  4 Committee  conducted  an  inspection  on  29.11.2011  and  submitted  a  report  on  13.1.2012. The report of the Committee was brought to the notice of the university  only by a letter dated 1.5.2012. By the said letter dated 1.5.2012, which is impugned  in  the  writ  petition,  the  petitioner  university  was  informed  that  the  Executive  Committee of the Council of Architecture had resolved in its 116th meeting held on  19.4.2012 to reduce the intake from 80 to 40 from the academic year 2012-2013 for a  period of five years, on the basis of the report of the Expert Committee that inspected  the School on 29.11.2011. Aggrieved by the said decision of the Executive Committee  as communicated by the letter of the Registrar dated 1.5.2012, the university has  come up with the above writ petition. 10.  The  writ  petition came up for  admission along with a  miscellaneous  petition for an interim stay, on 22.6.2012. The learned Judge, before whom the writ  petition came up, admitted the writ petition and ordered notice in the miscellaneous  petition.  Thereafter,  the miscellaneous petition came up before me for  hearing on  13.7.2012. By then, the respondent had entered appearance. Therefore, after hearing  the counsel for the respondent, I passed an order on the same day, permitting the  petitioner university to continue to admit 80 students for the academic session 2012- 13, subject to certain conditions. The conditions imposed by me were as follows :  (i) that the petitioner university should not admit even a single student in  excess of the permitted intake, in view of the allegations of admission of students in  the previous academic session over and above the permitted intake; (ii) that the Secretary to Higher Education Department of the Government  of  Tamilnadu, should conduct an investigation into the circumstances  under which  excess admissions were made in the past;  (iii)  that  the  petitioner  university  should  also  rectify  the  two  major  5 deficiencies  pointed  out  in  the  inspection  report  namely  that  of  lack  of  adequate  teaching faculty and the lack of adequate built up area.  11.  On the basis  of  the above interim order,  the petitioner admitted 80  students  and  they  have  also  submitted  that  they  complied  with  the  conditions  imposed. Thereafter, the writ petition was taken up for hearing.  12.  As  I  have  pointed  out  in  my  interim  order  dated  13.7.2012,  the  respondent had alleged certain deficiencies, which can be grouped under the following  three categories : (a) illegal admission of students in excess of the actual permitted intake  right from the academic session 2007-2008 onwards;  (b) the total number of teaching faculty being less than the minimum; and (c)  the  built  up  area  being  less  than  the  required  extent  or  required  standard.  13. Today, it is submitted by the learned Additional Advocate General that  all the three deficiencies stand rectified. According to the learned Additional Advocate  General, (i) the admission for the current academic session 2012-2013 was strictly  confined to only 80 and there was no excess admission; (ii) the vacancies in the post  of teaching faculty have been filled up; and (iii) the deficiencies with regard to the  built up area are rectified.  14. In response to the above submission of the learned Additional Advocate  General, Mr.N.Muralikumaran, learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the  it  is  for  the  Committee  of  Experts  to  verify  physically  the  rectification  of  the  deficiencies and that the Council can make an inspection and arrive at a conclusion, on  the basis of the ground realities. In other words, the rectification of deficiencies falling  under the second and third categories, has to be verified physically by the Committee  6 of Experts and it can be left to the Council of Architecture to conduct an inspection and  take a decision in accordance with law.  15. But in so far as the allegation relating to admission of students in excess  of the permitted intake is concerned, both the learned Additional Advocate General  and the  learned counsel  for  the  respondent  submitted that  there  are  grey  areas,  created by Court orders and regulations.",

There are also two other suits, filed by the 5th defendant herein,  challenging his removal from Trusteeship and Correspondentship of the 6th  defendant College. But I chose to deal with the above suit first, as it happens  to be a Scheme suit. If a Scheme is framed for the administration of the  Trust in that suit, the other two suits will automatically fall in line. 3. I  have heard Mr.R.Muthukumarasamy, learned senior counsel  for  the plaintiffs, Mr.S.Prabhakaran, learned counsel appearing for defendants 1  and 2, Mr.A.Narayanan, learned counsel for the third defendant, Mr.R.Yashod  Vardhan,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  fourth  defendant  and  Mr.K.Harishankar, learned counsel for the fifth defendant.  4.

(k) that the said land was in Survey No.510 of Kovilvenni Village and it  belonged to the Southern Railway; (l) that the said land was given by the Southern Railway to the Trust  on the basis of an unequivocal statement made by M.Namasivayam to the  5 effect  that  there  was  an  unbreakable  link  between  the  Southern  Railway  Mazdoor Union and the Mazdoor Welfare Trust;

I have heard Mrs.Chitra Sampath, learned Senior Counsel for the  plaintiff,  Mr.V.Raghavachari,  learned  counsel  for  the  first  defendant,  Mr.Zafarullah Khan, learned counsel for the second defendant, Mr.P.B.Balaji,  learned counsel for the third defendant and Mr.K.V.Rajan, learned counsel for  the fourth defendant. 3. The averments contained in the plaint, in brief, are as follows:- (i) The plaintiff is a Public Charitable Trust, founded by name P.T.Lee  Chengalvaroya Naicker  under  a  Will  dated  04.9.1870 and a  Codicil  dated  30.4.1873. 3 (ii)  The  Trustees  of  the  plaintiff-Trust  are  the  Trustees  of  another  Public Charitable Trust known as Pachaiyappa's Charities. (iii)  In  December  1980,  the  management  of  the  Pachaiyappa's  Charities  was  taken  over  by  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu.  Consequently,  the  management of the plaintiff-Trust was also taken over. (iv) However, the Tamil Nadu Act, 11 of 1981, by which the Trust was  taken over, was struck down by this Court in a writ petition and the same  was confirmed by the Supreme Court. (v)  Now  the  plaintiff-Trust  is  managed  by  an  Interim  Committee  appointed  by  this  Court  in  C.S.No.242  of  1986,  as  per  G.O.Ms.No.719,  Education, Science and Technology Department, dated 07.10.1996. (vi)  The  plaintiff-Trust  is  the  absolute  owner  of  the  suit  schedule  property, measuring about 11.115 grounds bearing Door Nos.69, 69-A, 69-B  and 69-C,  Maddox Road and Door No.28, Salai Street, Choolai, Chennai-112. (vii) By a Resolution dated 12.5.1975, the Trustees of Pachaiyappa's  Charities decided to lease out the said property to one K.K.Mochu Mohamed,  for a period of 20 years with a clause for renewal by a further period of 20  years. (viii)  On  a  Originating  Summons  taken  out  by  the  Trustees  of  Pachayappa's Charities in C.S.No.241 of 1975, this Court granted permission  for the said lease on 12.12.1975. As per the approval granted by this Court,  the Lessee was entitled to put up constructions on the land at his own cost,  but,  should hand over the same along with the land at the expiry of  the  4 period of lease. (ix) In pursuance of the aforesaid order, a Deed of Lease was executed  and  registered  on  09.01.1976,  but  the  possession  was  handed  over  on  22.12.1975 itself. (x)  On the same day, the Lessee K.K.Kochu Mohamed, executed a  Deed of Sub-Lease in favour of the first defendant for a period of 20 years  with an option to renew the same for a further period of 20 years. (xi) Since the original Lessee never paid any rent to the plaintiff from  the  inception of  the  lease and since  the lease  amounts  sent  by  the  first  defendant were refused to be accepted by the plaintiff, the very transaction  is invalid in law. (xii)  However,  subsequently,  by  a  Resolution  dated  27.3.1977,  the  Board of Trustees resolved to accept the first defendant as the direct Lessee,  on the basis of a letter written by the original Lessee, K.K.Kochu Mohamed. (xiii) In pursuance of the same, an unregistered Agreement of Lease  was entered into by the Trustees of the Pachaiyappa's Charities with the first  defendant, on 08.7.1977. (xiv) The said Agreement was also illegal, since the Trust never took  the permission of this Court and the Agreement was also unregistered. (xv) Unfortunately, the Trustees of the Board of Trustees did not take  any steps to take possession of the property from the first defendant, despite  the lease being illegal. Therefore, the Committee of management constituted  under the Tamil Nadu Act 11 of 1981, terminated the tenancy by a legal  5 notice dated 21.6.1995, on the basis that the initial period of 20 years was in  any way coming to an end on 08.01.1996. (xvi) But the first defendant sent a reply dated 07.7.1995, claiming  protection under the provisions of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection  Act,  on the ground that they had put up superstructure on the leasehold  land. (xvii)  Thereafter,  the  plaintiff  sent  another  legal  notice  dated  18.6.1996, calling upon the first defendant to deliver vacant possession and  also to pay Rs.50,000/- per month towards damages for use and occupation,  from  09.01.1996  onwards.  The  first  defendant  again  sent  a  reply  dated  02.7.1996 on the same lines as in the previous reply. (xviii) While the second defendant is in possession of a godown with  AC sheet roofing, measuring a plinth area of 3,309 sq. ft., marked as Plot  No.1 in the sketch attached to the plaint, the third defendant is in possession  of 3 godowns with AC sheet roofing, measuring a total plinth area of 11,766  sq. ft., marked as Plot Nos.2, 3 and 4 in the sketch attached to the plaint and  the fourth defendant is in possession of a shed measuring a plinth area of  2,726 sq. ft., marked as Plot No.5 in the sketch attached to the plaint. (xix)  At  the  time  when  the  first  defendant  got  an  unregistered  Agreement of Lease executed on 08.7.1977, the property was not merely a  vacant land, but had a construction already put up by the original Lessee,  K.K.Kochu Mohamed.  Therefore,  the first  defendant  cannot  claim to be a  Lessee of a vacant site. 6 (xx) In any case, the first defendant is not in possession and hence,  cannot claim the benefits of the Tamil Nadu City Tenants Protection Act. The  entire suit property is in possession of the defendants 2 to 4, as shown in the  sketch attached to the plaint. (xxi) The plaintiff is a Public Charitable Trust and hence, exempt from  the provisions of the Tamil Nadu Act 18 of 1960. (xxii) The permission granted by this Court to grant a lease in favour of  K.K.  Kochu Mohamed contained a stipulation that upon the expiry of  the  period of lease, the Lessee should hand over both the land and the building  to the plaintiff. Therefore, the first defendant cannot now make a claim on  the basis of the superstructure. In any case, the lease in favour of the first  defendant is invalid and hence, the first defendant cannot claim the benefits  of a lawful Lessee. 4. On the basis of the above averments, the plaintiff has prayed for a  decree (i) directing delivery of possession of the suit schedule property; (ii)  directing the defendants to pay a sum of Rs.9.00 lakhs towards damages for  use  and  occupation  from  09.01.1996  to  09.7.1997;  (iii)  directing  the  defendants to  pay future damages for  use  and occupation at  the rate  of  Rs.1.00 lakh per month from the date of the suit till the date of delivery of  the property. 5. The first defendant has filed a written statement. The averments  contained in the written statement of the first defendant, can be summarised  as follows:- 7 (i) A reading of the averments contained in the plaint would establish  that the first defendant is a tenant, within the meaning of Section 2(4) of the  Madras City Tenants Protection Act and hence, the first defendant has filed a  separate application, seeking the benefits of Section 9. (ii)  The  plaintiff  is  neither  a  Religious  Institution  nor  a  Religious  Charity. (iii) By the proceedings dated 27.3.1977, the plaintiff accepted the first  defendant as a direct Lessee and entered into a Memorandum of Lease for a  period of 20 years. (iv) The first defendant has been regularly paying the rent and had  also exercised a right of renewal. (v) The challenge made to the validity of the lease after more than 20  years, is barred by limitation.",

            "content":"1 In the High Court of Judicature at Madras  Dated : 13-06-2013 Coram : The Honourable Mr.Justice V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN Writ Petition No.6430 of 2013 Mrs.S.Yasmine ...Petitioner  Vs 1.The Secretary, Tamilnadu Public Service    Commission, Chennai-3. 2.The Deputy Secretary-cum-Information    Officer, Tamilnadu Public Service Commission    Chennai-3. ...Respondents PETITION under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, praying for the issue of  a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus to call for the records in Memo.No.7426/R1/D1/BST  /C2/2012 dated 11.2.2013 issued by the second respondent,  quash the same and  further direct the respondents to treat the petitioner as backward class (Muslim) and  provide her employment opportunity in the selection process of the respondents.  For Petitioner : Ms.Sudarshana Sundar  For Respondents : Ms.C.N.G.Niraimathi  O R D E R The petitioner was born to a couple belonging to Christian Nadar community  classified as backward community. It appears that she converted herself to Islam and  married a Muslim gentleman.  2. In response to the Notification issued by the Tamilnadu Public Service  Commission calling for applications for selection to Group IV Services in the State of  Tamilnadu,  issued in April  2012, the petitioner  applied. She was successful  in the  written examination conducted on 7.7.2012 and hence,  by a communication dated  2 30.11.2012, she was invited for  counselling and verification of  certificates held on  26.12.2012.  3. At the time of counselling, the petitioner was informed that since she  converted  herself  from  Christianity  to  Islam,  she  will  be  treated  as  a  candidate  belonging to 'other communities' not entitled to any reservation. Subsequently, the  same was also confirmed by the Public Information Officer of the Tamilnadu Public  Service  Commission  by  a  communication  dated  11.2.2013,  holding  that  the  candidature of the petitioner stood rejected, as she had crossed the upper age limit of  30 years, which was fixed for open category candidates. The upper age limit fixed for  backward communities was 35 and the petitioner had completed 31 years 2 months  and 9 days on the crucial date. Therefore, challenging the said communication, the  petitioner  has  come  up  with  the  above  writ  petition  seeking  issue  of  a  Writ  of  Mandamus  to  direct  the  respondents  to  treat  her  as  a  candidate  belonging  to  backward community (Muslim).            4. I have heard Ms.Sudarshana Sundar, learned counsel for the petitioner and  Ms.C.N.G.Niraimathi, learned counsel appearing for the respondents. 5. There are no disputes on facts. The fact that the petitioner hailed from a  family of Christian Nadars categorised as a backward class community, the fact that  she got converted to Islam and married a Muslim gentleman and the fact that she had  crossed the age of 30 years are all admitted on both sides. If the petitioner is treated  as a candidate belonging to backward communities, she would have been treated as  within the upper age limit for recruitment. Her candidature is today rejected only on  the ground that  she is treated as a candidate belonging to  'other  categories',  for  whom, the upper age limit is fixed only as 30.  3 6. The stand taken by the respondents is :- (i) that once a person gets converted from one religion to another religion,  the community status that he or she originally had would stand eclipsed during the  period of continuance in the converted religion; and (ii) that by converting into another religion, a person cannot acquire a social  status of backwardness. 7. In the light of such a stand, two questions arise for consideration namely  (a) whether a person, upon conversion from one religion to another, can  claim the social status of backwardness enjoyed by persons, belonging to such sects in  that religion ? and (b)  whether,  upon conversion  from one  religion  to  another  religion,  the  convert would lose out of the social status enjoyed before conversion ? 8. A similar issue came up before me in two writ petitions W.P.Nos.9150 and  10859 of 2012, while sitting in Madurai Bench of Madras High Court. In that case also,  the writ petitioners earlier belonged to Hindu Nadar community and had got converted  into Islam. Without going into the merits of the issues in detail, I allowed both the writ  petitions  by  an  order  dated  10.1.2013,  following  a  judgment  rendered  by  Vinod  K.Sharma,J on 20.1.2011 in W.P.No.21864 of 2010. Apart from following the decision  of Vinod K.Sharma,J, I pointed out one more thing, namely  (i) that the right of a person to profess any religion, which includes a right  to get converted, is a Fundamental Right; and (ii) that when such conversion is genuine and not created as a make belief  affair  for  the  purpose  of  getting  some  benefit,  the  benefits  that  go  along  with  conversion cannot be deprived.  4 9. In the light of the decision that I had already taken at Madurai, the writ  petition was taken up even at the stage of admission on the impression that it is a  case covered by a precedent. But, in the course of hearing, it was demonstrated by  the learned Standing Counsel for the respondents that the issue raised in the writ  petition is not as simple as I had presumed it to be at Madurai. Therefore, I heard the  learned counsel on both sides at length.  Question No.1 : 10. As pointed out earlier, the first question that arises for consideration is  as to whether a person, upon conversion from one religion to another, would acquire  the status of backwardness, as available to the others, who are born in that religion.  This question does not pose any great difficulty. No person can acquire backwardness  or  most  backwardness  socially,  upon  conversion  from  one  religion  to  another.  Backwardness is determined by birth and not by conversion. Today, a person, who  belongs to a community, which is a forward community, cannot get converted to Islam  and suddenly become eligible to claim the benefit of reservation available to backward  class (Muslim).  If this is permitted, the yardstick for determining social backwardness  will be left entirely to the will of the individual. Therefore, on the first question, there  can be only one answer namely that by conversion, a person cannot acquire the social  status that is normally available to persons already professing that religion.  Question NO.2 : 11. The second question that arises for consideration is as to whether a  person professing a particular religion and belonging to a backward or most backward  or  scheduled  caste  community,  would  lose  even  that  status  merely  by  getting  converted into another religion or not. This question appears to be a little tricky and is  actually on a slippery slope, as evidenced by my own decision at Madurai.  5 12. Ms.C.N.G.Niraimathi, learned counsel for the respondents relies upon  the decision of the Supreme Court in  Kailash Sonkdar Vs. Smt.Mayadevi [1984  (2) SCC 91]. The questions that came up for consideration before the Supreme Court  in that case were  (i) as to what happens if a member of the scheduled caste or scheduled  tribe leaves his present fold, namely Hinduism and embraces Christianity or Islam ? (ii) as to whether it would amount to a complete loss of the original caste,  to which, he belonged for ever ? and (iii) as to whether there would be revival of the original caste, if he or his  children subsequently choose to abjure the new religion and get re-converted to the  old religion ? 13. In paragraph 12 of its decision, the Supreme Court posed the following  questions to itself :  (i) is membership in a caste or tribe to be determined solely by birth or by  allegiance or by the opinion of its members or of the neighbourhood ? and (ii) does one lose his caste on conversion or by ex-communication ? 14. To find out an answer to these questions, the Supreme Court referred to  the  triple  test  laid  down  in  Chatturbhuj  Vithaldas  Jasani  Vs.  Moreshwar  Parashram (AIR 1954 SC 236). The triple test is (i) the reactions of the old body;  (ii) the intentions of the individual; and (iii) the rules of the new order. If the old order  is tolerant of the new faith and seems no reason to out-cast or ex-communicate the  convert  and  the  individual  himself  desires  or  intends  to  retain  his  old  social  and  political ties, the conversion is only nominal for all practical purposes. It was further  pointed out by the Supreme Court in Jasani, which was cited with approval in Kailash  Sonkar that if a convert had shown, by his conduct and dealings that his break from  6 the old order is so complete and final, that he no longer regards himself as a member  of the old body and there is reconversion and re-admittance to the old fold, it would  be wrong to hold  that  he  can nevertheless  claim temporal  privileges  and political  advantages, which are special to the old order.  15.  In  Kailash  Sonkar,  the  Supreme  Court  referred  to  the  decision  in  S.Rajagopal  Vs.  C.M.Arumugam  (AIR  1969  SC  101),  to  point  out  that  the  question as to what happens after the reconversion was left undecided in Arumugam.  The Court then referred to the latter decision in  G.M.Arumugam Vs.S.Rajagopal  (AIR  1976  SC  939)  and  to  the  subsequent  decision  in  S.Anbalagan  Vs.  B.Devarajan (AIR 1984 SC 411).",

Heard  Mr.G.Vasudevan,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners,  Ms.M.Nirmaladevi, learned Additional Central Government Standing Counsel for the  respondents  1  and  2  and  Mr.Rathina  Ashokan,  learned  counsel  for  the  third  respondent.  3. Fly ash, which causes enormous amount of air  pollution and which is  considered to be hazardous to the environment, is generated in huge quantity by  thermal power plants. In order to reduce the impact of fly ash on the environment,  the Government of India issued a Draft Notification containing certain directions on  22.5.1998  under  Rule  5(3)  of  the  Environment  (Protection)  Rules,  1986.  After  receiving objections and suggestions to the Draft Notification, a Final Notification was  published  by  the  Government  of  India  on  14.9.1999,  in  exercise  of  the  powers  conferred by Sub-Section (1) read with Clause (v) of Sub-Section (2) of Section 3 and  Section 5 of the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986.  4. The Final Notification was in three parts, dealing respectively with - (i) use of fly ash, bottom ash or pond ash in the manufacture of bricks and  in other construction activities; (ii) utilisation of ash by thermal power plants; and (iii) specifications for use of ash based products.  3 The first part of the Notification imposed a prohibition upon any person carrying on the  activity of manufacturing clay bricks or tiles or blocks for use in construction activities,  without mixing at least 25% of fly ash, if the activity is carried on within the radius of  50 Km from the thermal power stations. The second part of  the Final Notification  contained a direction to  every coal  or  lignite based thermal  power  plant  to  make  available, ash, for at least ten years from the date of publication of the Notification  without any payment or any other consideration, for the purpose of manufacturing ash  based products.  5. Subsequently, the Central Government also issued an amendment to the  above Notification by another Notification dated 27.8.2003. By the said Notification, a  mandate  was  issued  to  all  construction  agencies  engaged  in  the  construction  of  buildings within a radius of 50 - 100 Kms from a coal or lignite based thermal power  plant, to use fly ash bricks or blocks or tiles or clay fly ash bricks, etc., subject to a  minimum  percentage  mentioned  in  the  order  itself.  The  Amendment  Notification  preserved intact, the obligation of coal or lignite based thermal power plants to make  available,  ash,  for  the  purpose  of  manufacturing  ash  based  products  for  any  construction activity. Additionally, the Amendment Notification stated that the thermal  power plants have to ensure availability of fair quantity of ash to each user, including  brick kilns.  6.  Another  Draft  Notification was issued on 6.11.2008 proposing several  amendments  to  the  original  Notification.  This  Draft  Notification  was  issued,  after  taking note of the fact that though the use of fly ash in the manufacture of fly ash  bricks or products rose from 1.5 million tonnes in 2002-2003 to 3.15 million tonnes in  2006-2007,  the  target  was  not  achieved  as  on  31.8.2007.  Out  of  the  several  amendments proposed in the Draft Notification dated 6.11.2008, the portions relating  4 to paragraph 2 of the Original Notification are relevant for our purpose. Hence, they  are extracted as follows :   \"(1) : All coal or lignite based thermal power stations would be  free  to  sell  fly  ash  to  the  user  agencies  subject  to  the  following   conditions, namely:-  (i) The pond ash and mound ash should be made available free  of any charge on 'as is where is'  basis to manufacturers of  bricks,   blocks or  tiles  including clay fly  ash product manufacturing unit(s),   farmers,  the  Central  Government  and  the  State  Road  Construction  Agencies,  Public  Works  Department,  and  to  agencies  engaged  in  backfilling or stowing of mines. (ii) At least 20% of dry ESP fly ash shall be made available free   of charge to units manufacturing fly ash or clay-fly ash bricks, blocks   and tiles on a priority basis over other users. If the demand from such  agencies falls short of 20% of quantity, the balance quantity can be   sold or disposed of by the power station as may be possible.  Provided  that  the  fly  ash  obtained  from  the  thermal  power  station  should  be  utilised  only  for  the  purpose  for  which  it  was  obtained from the thermal power station or plant failing which no fly  ash shall be made available to the defaulting users\";  and  \"(6) :  The amount collected from sale of  fly ash and fly ash  based products by coal and/or lignite based thermal power stations or   their subsidiary or sister concern unit, as applicable should be kept in  a separate account head and shall be utilised only for development of  infrastructure or facilities and promotion/facilitation activities for use  of  fly  ash  until  100  percent  fly  ash  utilisation  level  is  achieved.   Thereafter as long as 100% fly ash utilisation levels are maintained,  the  thermal  power  station  would  be  free  to  utilise  the  amount  collected for other development programmes also. In case, there is a  reduction in the fly ash utilisation levels in the subsequent year(s), the  use of financial return from fly ash shall get restricted to development   of infrastructure or facilities and promotion or facilitation activities for  5 fly ash utilisation until  100 percent fly ash utilisation level  is  again  achieved and maintained.\"  7. After receiving objections and suggestions to the Draft Notification dated  6.11.2008, the Government of India issued a Final Notification dated 3.11.2009. In so  far as paragraph 2 of the Original Notification is concerned, the Final Notification dated  3.11.2009 accepted the draft amendments. Therefore, paragraphs 2(1) and (6), of the  Draft  Notification  dated  6.11.2008  were  retained  in  the  Final  Notification  dated  3.11.2009. 8.  Though  the  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity  Board  was  complying  with  the  aforesaid notifications, they found over a period of time that they were incurring an  expenditure of Rs.578/- per ton, for the collection of fly ash. Therefore, they decided  to  recover  at  least  a  portion  of  the  cost  so  incurred  and  consequently,  started  demanding a sum of Rs.100/- per ton from the units manufacturing fly ash based  products. This was done with effect from 15.10.2009. 9. Aggrieved by the collection of the charges, the Tamil Nadu Fly Ash Bricks  and Blocks Manufacturers Association filed a writ petition in W.P.No.3444 of 2010 on  the file of this Court, praying for a direction to the Electricity Board to allot 20% of the  ESP fly ash free of cost. The said writ petition was disposed of by a common order  dated 30.4.2010, directing the State Government to constitute a Dispute Settlement  Committee,  in each Thermal  Power  Plant,  as per  the composition indicated in the  notification. The State Government was also directed to streamline the functioning of  the State Level Monitoring Committee, for the purpose of  resolution of unresolved  disputes. The Green Bench of this Court also observed in paragraph 25 of its order  that  the  Electricity  Board  and  the  Thermal  Power  Stations  must  implement  the  notification  of  the  Government  of  India  in  letter  and spirit,  without  allowing  their  commercial interest to come in the way of fulfilling the social objective of allotting  6 20% of the fly ash. 10. Thereafter, the third respondent herein (Association) filed another writ  petition  in  W.P.No.12092  of  2010  seeking  to  forbear  the  Electricity  Board  from  collecting service charges.",

Petitioner   Vs. 1. M/s. India Info Line Securities Private Limited     rep. by its Managing Director (Trade Member)     Bldg. No.24, Nirlon Complex     Off Western Express Highway     Goregaon (East), Mumbai 400 063. 2. V.Natarajan .. Respondents Petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996,  read with Order XLIII, Rule 7 of the O.S. Rules. ----- For Petitioner :   Mr.R.Yashodh Vardhan, S.C.     For Mr.M.Ramamoorthy  For Respondents :   Mr.V.Venkatasamy  ----- O R D E R This  is  a  petition  filed  under  Section  34  of  the  Arbitration  and  Conciliation  Act,  1996,  seeking  to  set  aside  the  award  passed  by  the  Arbitrator. 2.  Heard  Mr.R.Yashodh  Vardhan,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  petitioner and Mr.V.Venkatasamy, learned counsel for the respondents. 3. The petitioner entered into a Broker-Client agreement with the first  2 respondent herein. The first respondent is a Trading Member of the National  Stock  Exchange  of  India  Limited.  Clause  8  of  the  said  agreement  dated  23.8.2003 visualises a minimum margin deposit by the client, without which  the trading cannot be done on behalf of the client. If the minimum margin  deposit falls below the amount prescribed, the trading operations may have  to  be  suspended.  Under  Clause  10.1.1  of  the  said  agreement,  a  printed  contract had to be despatched by the first respondent to the petitioner and  all transactions had to be confirmed through the net. 4. Several  transactions took place in terms of  the said agreement,  both by way of  purchase as well as by way of  sale of  shares.  But,  from  October 2005, the first respondent started claiming that the account of the  petitioner was in constant debit. Claiming that as on 08.7.2005, the debit  balance accumulated to Rs.8,18,524.35, the first respondent raised a claim  against the petitioner for payment of the said amount. Since the petitioner  repudiated the claim, the first respondent initiated arbitration proceedings in  the National Stock Exchange of India Limited, by filing Form I. The National  Stock Exchange of India Limited issued a notice calling upon the petitioner (i)  to submit a list of five persons in Form II, among those eligible to act as  Arbitrators, in the order of preference; and (ii)  to submit his defence in Form  III,  with  supporting  documents,  along  with  Rs.8,000/-  towards  fee  cum  deposit. 5. Accordingly, the petitioner submitted Forms II and III, along with a  cheque for Rs.8,000/- on 03.9.2005. The sole Arbitrator, appointed by the  3 National Stock Exchange of India Limited, heard the matter and eventually,  passed an award on 07.02.2006, directing the petitioner herein to pay to the  first respondent a sum of Rs.7,04,975/-, together with interest at 12% per  annum. Challenging the said award,  the petitioner  has come up with the  above petition under Section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act. 6. The petitioner has challenged the award of the Arbitrator primarily  on the following grounds: (i) that the Arbitrator concluded the proceedings and passed an award,  without acceding to or even disposing of his request for a direction to the first  respondent to submit certain details and materials; (ii) that he was not given adequate opportunity and the mandatory  procedure under Sections 23(2) and 24 of the Arbitration and Conciliation  Act, 1996, was given a go by; and (iii) that the Arbitrator failed to appreciate the provision for minimum  margin deposit  money and the effect  of  Clause 10.1.1 of  the agreement,  especially in the context of the trading done by the first respondent to the  tune of about Rs.2.60 Crores, on 9th and 10th of May 2005. 7. I have carefully considered the above contentions. It is needless to  point out that the scope of an enquiry under Section 34 of the Act is very  limited.  A  Court  is  entitled  to  set  aside  an arbitration  award,  only  if  the  petitioner satisfies the Court (a) that he was under some incapacity; (b) that  the arbitration agreement was not valid under the law to which the parties  have subjected themselves; (c) that he was not given proper notice of the  4 appointment of the Arbitrator or of the arbitral proceedings, or otherwise was  unable to present his case; (d) that the arbitral award deals with a dispute  not  contemplated  by  or  not  falling  within  the  terms  of  submission  to  arbitration; (e) that the composition of the Tribunal was not in accordance  with the agreement of the parties; (f) that the subject matter of the dispute  is not capable of settlement by arbitration; and (g) that the arbitral award is  in conflict with the public policy of the country. 8.  The  grounds  on  which  the  petitioner  challenges  the  arbitration  award do not fall under Section 34(2)(a)(ii) or (iv) or (v) or Section 34(2)(b).  At  the  most,  the  grounds  raised  by  the  petitioner  could  fall  only  under  Section 34(2)(a)(i) or (iii). In other words, the contentions raised can, at the  most,  come  under  the  category  of  (a)  the  petitioner  being  under  some  incapacity; or (b) the petitioner not being given proper notice of the arbitral  proceedings,  or  (c)  the  petitioner  being  otherwise,  unable  to  present  his  case. The main grievance of the petitioner is that he was unable to present  his case and was under some incapacity, due to the non furnishing of the  information and documents sought for by him. Therefore, it is necessary to  test  whether  the  case  of  the  petitioner  would  fall  under  any  of  these  categories. 9. The award of the Arbitrator shows that the claim made by the first  respondent  in  Form  I  was  sent  to  the  Arbitrator,  along  with  a  set  of  documents,  by  the  National  Stock  Exchange,  on  08.9.2005.  As  per  the  award, further written submissions were made by the Trading Member on  5 three dates, namely, 21.10.2005, 13.01.2006 and 31.01.2006. 10. The petitioner's  reply in Form III,  along with other  documents,  were sent to the Arbitrator to the National Stock Exchange on 08.9.2005. As  per the award, further written submissions were made by the petitioner on  07.10.2005, 04.11.2005, 21.12.2005, 30.12.2005, 13.01.2006, 16.01.2006  and 06.02.2006. 11. The arbitration award also proceeds on the footing that the hearing  took place on two days namely 07.10.2005 and 16.01.2006. Therefore, it is  clear even from the arbitral award that at least one written submission was  made by the petitioner, after the hearing on 16.01.2006. The petitioner had  made submission on the date of the hearing, namely 16.01.2006. He also  made submission subsequently on 06.02.2006. 12. The case of the first respondent is also akin. The first respondent  made  one  set  of  written  submission  on  13.01.2006  and  another  written  submission  on  31.01.2006,  after  the  last  date  of  hearing,  namely  16.01.2006. Therefore, in order to appreciate the contention raised by the  petitioner, it is necessary to have a look at the contents of the submissions  made by the petitioner on the date of last hearing, namely 16.01.2006 and  on the subsequent date, namely 06.02.2006. 13.  The  copy of  the  written submission  made by the  petitioner  on  16.01.2006 shows that the petitioner made a specific demand for providing  the contract notes pertaining to the date 14.3.2005. He also indicated in the  last  line  of  the  written  submissions  made  on  16.01.2006  that  he  would  6 submit a reply within seven days of receipt of the documents/clarifications.  14. By a letter dated 31.01.2006, the National Stock Exchange of India  Limited forwarded to the petitioner the copy of the contract notes received  from the first respondent on 31.01.2006. That means, the contract  notes  sought  by  the  petitioner  by  his  representation  dated  16.01.2006  was  provided to him only after the last date of hearing. 15. Similarly, the petitioner sent a letter dated 06.02.2006, requesting  the National Stock Exchange to verify the veracity of  the contents of the  contract  notes  from  their  data  base.  To  this  letter,  the  National  Stock  Exchange sent a reply dated 07.02.2006, attaching the details of the trades  executed in the client code of the petitioner on 14.3.2005. But, the Arbitrator  passed an award on 07.02.2006 itself.  16.  Therefore,  the  contention  that  the  petitioner  was  not  given  adequate  opportunity  to  present  his  case  appears  to  be  justified.  The  contract  notes demanded by the petitioner  and furnished by the National  Stock Exchange, formed an important part of the defence that the petitioner  had to the claim of the first respondent. Their significance was explained by  the petitioner in his letter dated 10.02.2006. But, by that time, the award  had already been passed by the Arbitrator and nothing remained. Therefore,  I  am of the view that the case of the petitioner would fall under Section  34(2)(a)(i)  and  (iii),  in  the  sense  that  the  petitioner  was  under  some  incapacity to make a proper presentation and he was otherwise unable to  present  his  case,  due  to  the  non  receipt  of  documents  and  particulars",

For Petitioner in all WPs        :  Mr.M.S.Subramanian For Respondents-1 to 3 in all WPs   :  Mr.S.Gomathinayagam, AAG                                                                  Assisted by Mr.N.Srinivasan, AGP For Respondent-4 in all WPs        :  Mr.V.Bharathidhasan   C O M M O N  O R D E R The petitioners  have  come up with the above writ  petitions,  challenging an  order passed by the District Collector, Chennai, holding that certain lands in question  are classified as Government Poramboke and as Pattina Natham and that therefore,  the petitioners are not entitled to any compensation for eviction from those lands. 2. I have heard Mr.M.S.Subramanian, learned counsel for the petitioners, Mr.S.  Gomathinayagam, learned Additional Advocate General, assisted by Mr.N.Srinivasan,  learned  Additional  Government  Pleader  for  respondents  1  to  3  and  Mr.V.  Bharathidhasan, learned Standing Counsel for the fourth respondent. 3. The petitioners, in these writ petitions, were in occupation of various extents  of lands in T.S.Nos.145/2, 150/2, 157/2, 158/2, 159/2 and 160/2, in Block No.52,  Konnur Village, Purasaiwakkam-Perambur Taluk, Chennai District. The petitioners had  also put up superstructures on those lands and were residing in the properties for over  several  decades,  claiming that their  predecessors-in-title, had purchased the lands  from a Government Servants' Cooperative Society. The petitioners were served with  notices  under  Section  7  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Land  Encroachment  Act,  1905,  on  27.6.2008, on the ground that they were in occupation of Government Poramboke  lands and that  these  lands  were  required for  the  formation of  a Railway Subway  Project.  The  petitioners  submitted replies  through their  counsel  on  17.7.2008 and  came up with a batch of writ petitions in W.P.Nos.18311 to 18316 of 2008. Since the  5 writ  petitions were classified under the heading \"encroachment\",  the writ  petitions  were listed before a Division Bench of this Court. By a short order dated 13.10.2008,  the writ petitions were disposed of with a direction. The brief order of the Division  Bench, disposing of the writ petitions, reads as follows:- \"Heard the learned counsel for the parties. 2. Subject  matter  of  the challenge in  the above  writ petitions is a notice issued under Section 7 of the Tamil  Nadu  Land  Encroachment  Act  3  of  1905.  It  appears  that  pursuant to the said notice, all the six petitioners have given  their  objections  on  2.7.2008,  3.7.2008,  31.7.2008,  31.7.2008,  31.7.2008  and  31.7.2008  respectively  and  the  respective  petitioners  were  put  on  notice  about  the  compensation amount. In that view of the matter, this Court   dismisses the above writ petitions by directing the Authority   under the Tamil  Nadu Land Encroachment Act, to consider  the objections of the respective petitioners  and dispose of   the same within one month from today. Such disposal shall   be  after  hearing  all  the  parties  concerned.  No  costs.   Miscellaneous petitions are closed.\" 4.  In  pursuance  of  the  aforesaid  order,  the  petitioners  filed  further  objections on 24.10.2008 and also participated in the enquiry. But, by separate orders  dated 10.11.2008, the Tahsildar rejected the objections of the petitioners. The short  ground on which the Tahsildar rejected the objections of the petitioners is that in the  Permanent Land Records, the classification of the lands in question had been entered  as \"Cirkar Poramboke Village Natham\". 5. Challenging the orders of  the Tahsildar dated 10.11.2008, the petitioners  filed a batch of writ petitions in W.P.Nos.27129 of 2008 batch of cases, on the file of  this Court. Before the Division Bench before which, these batch of writ petitions came  up for hearing, the respondents took two objections viz.",

Heard Mr.G.Venkataraman, learned counsel for the petitioner and  Mr.K.M.Ramesh, learned counsel for the second respondent-workman. 3.  The  second  respondent  was  appointed  as  an  Assistant  in  the  petitioner-Bank in the year 1973. He was promoted as Secretary in the year  1983.  2 4. After an audit was conducted for the period 1985-86, disciplinary  proceedings were initiated against the second respondent and charge memo  dated  29.4.1987  was  issued.  The  second  respondent  did  not  submit  any  explanation. Therefore, an enquiry followed. 5. Three witnesses were examined on the side of the Management and  40 documents were marked. The second respondent did not examine any  witness, nor did he produce any document. 6. The Enquiry Officer held the charge Nos.1, 2, 3, 6, 7 as well as the  imputations in clauses (a) and (d) of charge No.8 as proved. He held charge  Nos.4, 5 and the other imputations of charge No.8 not proved. 7. The copy of the enquiry report dated 20.3.1992 was forwarded to  the second respondent and his explanation sought. Thereafter, by an order  dated 12.3.1993, the second respondent was dismissed from service. The  petition filed by the Management under Section 33(2)(b) of the Industrial  Disputes Act, 1947, in Approval Petition No.20 of 1993 was allowed and the  Tribunal granted approval by its order dated 08.3.1995. 8. The second respondent thereafter raised an industrial dispute in I.D.  No.92 of 1996. Before the Labour Court, the workman filed 5 documents and  the  Management  filed  about  88  documents.  The  second  respondent  also  made an endorsement to the effect that the domestic enquiry was conducted  in a fair and proper manner and that the dispute can be decided in terms of  Section 11-A. Thereafter, the Labour Court passed an award on 25.3.2003,  holding that none of the charges stood proved and that therefore, the second  respondent was entitled to be reinstated with full back wages. Challenging  the said award, the Management has come up with this writ petition. 9. Admittedly, an endorsement was made before the Labour Court on  3 behalf of the workman that the enquiry was held in a fair and proper manner.  Therefore, the scope of the adjudication that was required to be undertaken  by the Labour Court was confined only to what is stipulated by Section 11-A  of the Industrial Disputes Act, 1947. This is something on which the learned  counsel on both sides have no dispute. 10. In the light of the admitted fact that the scope of the adjudication  by the Labour Court was confined only to Section 11-A, Mr.G.Venkataraman,  learned counsel  for the petitioner/Management contended that the Labour  Court acted beyond the jurisdiction conferred under Section 11-A, as though  it was an Appellate Authority. Instead of merely testing whether the findings  of the Enquiry Officer were perverse or not and whether the findings of the  Enquiry Officer were based upon any acceptable evidence or not, the Labour  Court assessed the evidence independently, without even a reference to the  enquiry report and came to a conclusion that the charges were not proved.  This, according to the learned counsel for the petitioner, resulted in a serious  miscarriage of justice. 11. In brief, the contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner is  actually two fold. They are (i) that without even recording a finding as to  whether the findings of the Enquiry Officer were perverse or not, the Labour  Court went into a detailed analysis of the charges and evidence and came to  an independent conclusion; and (ii) that unless the findings of the Enquiry  Officer were based on no evidence or were perverse, the Labour Court ought  not to have acted as an Appellate Authority and interfered with the findings  of the Enquiry Officer. In support of this two fold contention, the learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  relied  upon  a  few decisions,  starting  from  the  decision of the Supreme Court in Firestone. 4 12. Since the scope of the enquiry to be conducted by me is confined  only to the aforesaid two fold contention, let me now have a look at the  principles enunciated in the decisions relied upon by the learned counsel for  the petitioner, before proceeding to consider the award of the Labour Court  and the report of the Enquiry Officer. 13. In Workmen of Firestone Tyre & Rubber Co. of India Ltd. v.  The Management (1973 Lab.I.C. 851), the interpretation to be given to  Section 11-A inserted with effect from 15th December 1971, was considered  by the Supreme Court. The decision in Firestone took note of the Statement  of Objects and Reasons behind the amendment Act and the four principles  laid down by the Supreme Court in its previous decision in  Indian Iron &  Steel Co. Ltd. (AIR 1958 SC 130). It was held in  Indian Iron & Steel  Co. Ltd. that the Tribunal could interfere (i) when there is want of good faith,  (ii)  when  there  is  victimisation  or  unfair  labour  practice,  (iii)  when  the  Management is guilty of a basic error or violation of a principle of natural  justice, and (iv) when on the materials, the finding is completely baseless or  perverse.  After  referring to the  above four  principles,  the Supreme Court  referred to various decisions which dealt with the consequences arising out of  an employer not holding any enquiry at all or holding an improper enquiry.  After taking into account the right of an employer to lead evidence before the  Industrial Tribunal, the Supreme Court summed up the broad principles that  held the field as on 15.12.1971, the date of coming into force of Section 11- A.  Thereafter,  from  paragraph  29  of  its  decision,  the  Supreme  Court  considered  the  question  as  to  whether  Section  11-A  brought  about  any  changes in the legal position mentioned in paragraph 27 and if so, to what  extent. 5 14.  To  find  an  answer  to  the  above  question,  the  Supreme  Court  divided the cases into two categories, namely, (i) those where an employer  had held a proper and valid domestic enquiry; and (ii) those where there has  been no enquiry at all or there was a defective enquiry. Insofar as cases  falling  under  the  first  category  are  concerned,  the  Supreme  Court  categorically held in paragraph 32 that \"the Tribunal is now at liberty to  consider not only whether the finding of misconduct recorded by an  employer  is  correct,  but  also  to  differ  from the  said  finding  if  a  proper case is made out\". As though to reinforce the above principle, the  Supreme Court also pointed out that \"what was once largely in the realm  of the satisfaction of the employer, has ceased to be so, and now it is   the satisfaction of the Tribunal that finally decides the matter\". Again  in  paragraph  36,  the  Court  reiterated  that  \"even  in  cases  where  an  enquiry has been held by an employer and a finding of misconduct   arrived at, the Tribunal can now differ from that finding in a proper   case and hold that no misconduct is proved\". 15. Therefore, Mr.G.Venkataraman, learned counsel for the petitioner  admitted that the Labour Court today has the power to differ from the finding  of the Enquiry Officer. However, the said power is subject to two conditions.  A clue to such conditions could be found out from paragraphs 32  and 48 of  the decision in Firestone. The first clue is that the power to differ from the  finding of the Enquiry Officer could be exercised only \"if a proper case is  made out\". The second clue indicated in paragraph 48 is that this power has  to be exercised by the Court \"by giving cogent reasons\". According to the  learned counsel for the petitioner, the award of the Labour Court in the case  on hand would fail both these tests. 6 16.  Though  the  learned counsel  for  the  petitioner  also  relied  upon  three  decisions  of  the  Supreme  Court,  one  in  State  of  Orissa  v.  Bidyabhushan Mohapatra (AIR 1963 SC 779), the second in Burn & Co.  Ltd. v. Workman (1970 (2) LLJ 56) and the third in Union of India v.  Parma Nanda (AIR 1989 SC 1185), I do not think that they would apply  to the case on hand. The first and third decision arose out of disciplinary  proceedings initiated against  the Government  servants  and the protection  afforded under Article 311(2) of the Constitution. The second decision related  to an industrial employee, but the said case arose before the introduction of  Section 11-A. Therefore, I would not advert to these decisions.",

The challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of learned Additional  District and Sessions Judge, Fast Track Court II, Coimbatore dated 15.05.2007  passed  in  S.C.No.146  of  2006,  convicting  the  appellant  and  another  for  offences under Sections 379 and 302 IPC and sentencing him to undergo three  years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.500/-, in default, six months simple  imprisonment for offence under section 379 IPC and to life imprisonment and  fine  of  Rs.5,000/-,  in  default,  three years  simple imprisonment  for  offence  under Section 302 IPC. The appellant is the second accused. The appeal of the  first  accused in Crl.A.No.1072 of 2007 was dismissed under judgment dated  10.07.2008. 2. The case of the prosecution is as follows: (i) On 17.06.2005, at about 12.30 p.m., at Periya Thottam, Madhanur  village, the  appellant/A2 along with A1, with an intent  to commit  robbery, has committed the murder of the deceased Eswariammal by  smothering  and  thereafter,  committed  theft  of  5  sovereigns  gold  chain and a gold stud. 3 (ii)The deceased is the mother of PW-1 and she was living with him. On  the date of occurrence, P.W.1 along with his wife and sons, went to  his  father-in-law's  village to attend  a temple  festival.  When P.W.1  returned at 06.00 p.m., the deceased was not found in the house and  therefore, he went in search of her. He enquired of PW-2 about his  mother,  who  informed  that  the  deceased  had  grazed  cattle  at  a  particular  place  and  thereafter,  left  at  noon.  P.W.1 proceeded to  Sirumugai Police Station on 18.06.2005 at 14.00 hours and preferred a  complaint to PW-9, Sub-Inspector of Police, who registered case of  'Woman  Missing'  in  Crime  No.211  of  2005.  Ex.P15  is  the  First  Information Report. He forwarded the report to P.W.12, Inspector of  Police, Mettupalayam, who took up  investigation. (iii)P.W.12,  proceeded  to  the  scene  village  at  15.00 hours,  prepared  observation mahazar, Ex.P7 and rough sketch Ex-P19 in the presence  of PW-3 and another witness. Thereafter,  he examined PWs.1 to 3  and  five  other  witnesses  and  recorded  their  statements.  At  about  8:30p.m., on 19-06-2005, while he was at the Police Station, P.Ws.2  and 4 and others came along with the accused persons and handed  over Ex-P8, statement of confession of the accused given to P.W.4.  The same informed that the accused had, on 17-06-2005, murdered  the  deceased  towards  stealing  her  jewellery.   PW.12  arrested  the  4 accused, interrogated them and before recording their confessional  statements, intimated the Tahsildar, Mettupalayam, who came to the  Police Station. Thereafter, the confession statements of the accused  were  recorded  at  08.30  a.m.  and  signatures  were  obtained  from  witnesses. The admissible portion of the confession of A1 is Ex-P17.  The admissible portion of the confession of A2 is Ex-P18. Thereunder,  the accused had disclosed the place where they had thrown the body  of the deceased and had undertaken to produce the jewellery stolen  by them.  Accordingly, P.W.12 proceeded to Madhanur Village and in  the presence of P.W.5, Village Administrative Officer and another, he  prepared observation mahazar, Ex-P9 and rough sketch, Ex-P20.  He  caused  photographs  in  M.O.5  series.  Thereafter,  the  body  was  removed  from  a  Well  and  identified  by  witnesses.  He  conducted  inquest over the body between 12.00 noon and 3.00 p.m. The inquest  report is Ex-P21.  He sent the body of the deceased to Coimbatore  Government  Hospital  through  P.W.8,  constable,  for  conduct  of  postmortem.  Thereafter,  on the  basis  of  confession of  A2, a gold  chain,  was  recovered  under   Ex-P6  from  a  fence  along  the  road  leading to his house. The gold chain is M.O.1. At about 16.00 hours,  the first accused produced a receipt, Ex-P13, from his pant pocket.  Pursuant  thereto,  P.W.12  proceeded  to  the  concerned  financial  5 corporation at Mettupalayam at about 16:45 hours and seized a pair  of  ear  studs  under  Ex-P5.  The  ear  studs  are  M.O.2.   He  further  examined PWs.3, 5, 7 and 11 and other witnesses and recorded their  statements.  He forwarded a report to learned Judicial  Magistrate,  Mettupalayam, informing the alteration of the FIR to reflect offence  under Section 302 IPC. The alteration report  is  Ex.P22.  On 20-06- 2005, he examined P.W.6, the Doctor,  who conducted postmortem  and  received  postmortem  report,  Ex-P11.  The  postmortem  report  reads as follows: \"P.M.No.1006/2005 dated 19.06.2005 Cr.No:211/2005 of Sirumugai P.S. Regarding the body of a female named Eswariammal aged   about 70 years.

It is also informed  that the viscera does not contain any poison.   (iv)In continuation of investigation, PW.12 sent the material objects to  Court for forwarding the same for chemical analysis.  On 22-06-2005,  he  examined  PW.9  and  other  witnesses  and  recorded  their  statements. He arranged for recording the statement of some of the  witnesses under Section 164 Cr.P.C.  Upon his requisition, under Ex- P16, P.Ws.1 to 8 were examined and their statements were recorded  under Section 164 Cr.P.C.  He received the Serology Report, Ex-P23  on 11-07-2005 and proceeded to Coimbatore to examine the expert.  After completion of investigation, he filed charge sheet against the  accused for offences under sections 302 and 379 IPC, on 15-07-2005.  3. To substantiate its case, the prosecution examined 12 witnesses and  marked 23 exhibits besides marking M.Os.1 to 5. On questioning under Section  313 Cr.P.C., the accused denied the charges. None were examined on behalf of  the appellant/accused nor were any exhibits marked. 8 4.  Learned  trial  Judge,  on  consideration  and  appreciation  of  the  evidence adduced by the prosecution, found both accused guilty,  convicted  and  sentenced  them as  stated  above.   Hence,  the  present  appeal  by  the  second accused. 5. Heard learned counsel  for  appellant  and  learned Additional  Public  Prosecutor. 6.  Learned  counsel  for  appellant  submits  that  the  facts  and  circumstances of the present case would not justify conviction of the accused,  for  offence  under  Section  302  IPC.  While  conceding  that  he  was  not  challenging the conviction under Section 379 IPC, learned counsel submits that  but  for  the  confessional  statements  alleged,  the  case  was  based  on  circumstantial evidence and unless the circumstances form a cohesive chain  and unerringly point to the guilt of the accused, the appellant could not be  convicted  for  the  offence  of  murder.  Learned  counsel  submits  that  the  extrajudicial confession alleged to have been made to P.W.4 by the accused on  19-06-2005 was highly doubtful.",

The following are the brief allegations contained in the plaint - 2[a]  The  plaintiffs  are  brothers  being  the  sons  of  Haji  Sheik  Dawood  Saheb.  The first defendant is the senior paternal uncle of the plaintiffs.  The  second defendant is the son of the first defendant.  The plaintiffs had another  senior paternal uncle by name Haji Mohammed Hussaian.  He died in the year  1968.  He had two sons and a daughter by names Habibullah, I.Ubaidullah and  Misiria Begam.  Habibullah died leaving behind the defendants 3 to 5 as his legal  heirs. Ubaidullah also died subsequently as bachelor and his heirs are defendants  3 3 to 6.  The mother of the 6th defendant Rafia Bibi also died in the year 1975 and  her heirs are the defendants 3 to 6 herein. 2[b] In the year 1948, two business were started in partnership between  N.A.Ardhanariappa  Mudaliar,  N.A.Ayyaswami  Mudaliar  sons  of  Arunachala  Mudaliar and the plaintiffs two uncles Mohammed Hussain Saheb, Mohammed  Abdul  Khader,  the  first  defendant  herein  and the  plaintiffs  father  Haji  Sheik  Dawood  Saheb.   Subsequently  the  members  of  the  families  of  the  partners  became partners. The first business was bus transport company run under the  name and style of A.M.S. Motor Service and another business was a rice and oil  mill  run  under  the  name  of  Eraichi  Masthan  Rice  and  Oill  Mill  at  Nanjayyampalayam, Coimbatore. 2[c] The aforesaid firm did not see eye to eye which resulted in the firm  being dissolved by a deed of dissolution dated 06.07.1968.  By that time, the  father  of  the  6th defendant  died.   After  the  said  dissolution,  all  the  partners  entered  into  a  registered  partition  deed  on  03.06.1970  in  respect  of  all  the  parties  of  the  erstwhile  partnership  firm.   Under  the  said  partnership  deed,  N.A.Ayyaswami Mudaliar and his two sons Arunachalam and Balasubramaniam  were allotted 'A' Schedule properties therein and Nos.4 to 11 therein who are  defendants 1, the father of the plaintiffs, the 2nd defendant, the plaintiffs herein,  4 first plaintiff No.7 therein and Rafia Bibi, their mother respectively were allotted  'B'  Schedule  properties  therein.    By  virtue  of  the  partition  deed  dated  03.06.1970,  eight persons mentioned above became jointly entitled to all  the  properties covered under 'B'  Schedule  and each party is  entitled to an 1/8th  share in all those properties. 2[d]  The  first  plaintiff  became  entitled  to  1/8th  share  and  the  2nd  defendant also became entitled another 1/8th share as per the partition deed  dated 03.06.1970.   The plaintiffs father who was also entitled to 1/8th share  died in the year 1979 leaving behind the plaintiffs, a widow by name Hajara Bibi  and  5  daughters  by  names  Noor  Jahaan  Sirajunnissa,  Hamurunnissa,  S.Sabirunnissa and K.Thanjunnissa.  The plaintiff's sister and mother executed a  registered release deed in favour of the plaintiff on 27.06.1984 and therefore the  plaintiffs have become entitled to 1/8th share of their father.  2[e]  The  'B'  Schedule  properties  of  the  partition  deed  comprise  of  a  building at Udumalpet and the present suit properties.    The plaintiffs as also all  other  owners  who  were  allotted  'B'  Schedule  properties  sold  the  building  at  Udumalpet to one T.Chinnaswami Chettiar on 16.09.1970.  The first defendant is  entitled to only 1/8th share in the suit properties  who was allotted under the  partition  deed  dated  03.06.1970  and  so  also  the  second  defendant.   The  5 plaintiff's senior paternal uncle's widow Rafia Bibi was entitled to 1/8th share and  she died during 1975 leaving behind two sons and a daughter.  Her 1/8th share  devolved on them.  Rafia Bibi's son Habibullah was entitled to 1/8th share as per  the partition deed dated 03.06.1970.   He died and his  share devolved upon  defendants 3 to 5.  Ubaidullah, another son of Rafia Bibi died as bachelor and his  share devolved on the defendants 3 to 6 herein.   The 6th defendant became  entitled to a share as the heir of her mother and also as heir to her brother  Ubaidullah.  The defendants 3 to 6 are entitled together to 3/8th share in the suit  properties and the defendants 9 and 10 are tenants of portions of the rice and oil  mill buildings and therefore added as parties to the suit. The first defendant died  during the pendency of the suit and hence defendants 11 and 12 are added as  his legal heirs. 2  [f]  The  Rice  and  Oil  Mill  had  several  machineries  described  in  'B'  Schedule of the partition deed dated 03.06.1970 and the first defendant had sold  expeller, decoricator 3 HP Electric Motor Oil Tank, Oil Filler and steamer to the 7th  defendant  and  he  has  no  right  or  authority  to  sell  the  same,  that  the  first  defendant  is  bound to  account  for  the  sale  proceeds,  that  similarly  the  first  defendant, without the right or authority and the permission has sold away a 25  HP, A.E.I. Electric motor with oil starter to the 8th defendant, that he is bound to  render  accounts  to the  plaintiffs  in  respect  of  the sale  proceeds  as the said  6 machineries may not be available, that in order to avoid technical objections, the  defendants 7 and 8 are added as parties to the suit and that they are added as  formal parties, that the plaintiffs have been demanding the first defendant to  effect partition of all the joint properties but the first defendant has been evading  the same and refused to agree for amicable partition. 3. In the written statement filed by D1 and D2, it is alleged as follows - 3 [a]  The allegations contained in the plaint are denied.  The plaintiffs are  not entitled for the relief of partitions and separate possession and as well as for  asking account as to the sale proceeds and that the relationship between the  parties interest mentioned in the plaint are correct, that the 1st defendant, 4th  defendant's grand father Haji Mohammed Hussan, the plaintiff's father Haji Sheik  Dawooth Sahib are brothers and they are not members of one family, that there  was no joint family among themselves and they lived separately from each other,  that the partnership concerned between the 1st defendant Ayyasami Mudaliar and  others  are  not  concerned  with  the  plaint  schedule  properties,  that  the  partnership did not concern with the properties purchased by the 1st defendant in  his individual name and the same were purchased by the 1st defendant in his  own  funds  and  not  from  the  funds  of  his  brothers   and  that  there  is  no  partnership deed among the parties with regard to 'Erachi Masthan Rice Mill'.   7 3 [b] 1st defendant purchased Item Nos.1 and 2 of the property as land  under two sale deeds on 26.10.1945 and under one sale deed dated 02.11.1945  and that the above two items of properties are the self-acquired  and separate  properties  of  the  1st defendant,  that  on  25.05.1963,  the  1st defendant,  his  brothers and other members of the family divided their family properties and  executed a partition deed and it is admitted by the parties that there is no other  property  among  themselves  to  be  divided,  that  the  partition  deed  dated  03.06.1970 mentioned in the plaint do not confer any title to any parties who are  not having any subsisting title and that the parties to the partition deed could not  get any right under the partition deed dated 03.06.1970 and that the same is  invalid in law. 3 [c] The plaintiffs are not entitled to 3/8th share in the suit properties,  that neither the plaintiffs nor their father are entitled for any share in the plaint  schedule properties, that the release deed dated 27.06.1984 is not binding on  the defendants 1 and 2, that the defendants 1 and 2 are neither parties to the  said Release Deed nor witnesses for the same and that the above two items of  properties are self acquired and separate properties of the 1st defendant. 3 [d] On 25.5.1963, the 1st defendant, his brothers and other members of  the family divided their family properties and executed a partition deed, that it is",

The District Collector,     Villupuram District. 2. The President,     Kanai Panchayat, Villupuram District. 3. R.Siva        .. Respondents Prayer:-   Writ  Petition  has  been  filed  under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution of India for issuance of Writ of Ceriorarified Mandamus  calling  for  the  records  relating  to  the  proceedings  in  Na.Ka.No.27/2003, dated 27.02.2003 passed by the 2nd respondent  and  quash  the  same and further  direct  the  second respondent  to  reinstate the petitioner with backwages, continuity of services and all  other consequential benefits.  For Petitioner    : Mr.K.Vasudevan For Respondent 1  : Mr.R.Rajeswaran, Slp.G.P. For Respondent 2 : Mr.R.Sunil Kumar - - - - - 2 O R D E R The present writ petition is filed challenging the order of the  second  respondent  dated  27.02.2003,  whereby,  the  petitioner's  service was terminated.   2. The petitioner was appointed as Pump Operator in the  second respondent Panchayat and he served for more than 23 years.  According to  the  petitioner,  the  second respondent  issued a  show  cause  notice  alleging  certain  lapses.  It  is  his  case  that  he  had  submitted his explanation immediately.  However, another notice was  issued by the second respondent on 04.02.2002, to which also he  submitted his explanation.  When that being the position, the present  impugned order was passed by the second respondent terminating  the service of the petitioner.   3. The petitioner challenges the impugned order mainly on  the ground that the same violates the principles of Natural Justice, in  view of  the  fact  that  no  enquiry  was  conducted  and no  sufficient  opportunity was given to the petitioner before passing the order of  termination. 4. Heard the learned counsel appearing on either side. 3 5. A bare perusal of the impugned order would show that  the same came to be passed without conducting any enquiry even  though five charges were framed against the petitioner.  No doubt, it  is stated in the impugned order that on three occasions the petitioner  was called upon to give his explanation before passing the impugned  order and that the petitioner had not given his explanation within the  stipulated time.   6. On the other hand, it is contended by the petitioner in the  affidavit  that  he  had  given  explanation  to  the  show  cause  notice  issued by the second respondent. 7. Though this writ petition was filed in the year 2003 and  notice  was  ordered  to  the  respondents  and  they  also  entered  appearance, till date no counter affidavit is filed before this Court. 8.  A bare perusal of the impugned order would show that  the same came to be passed without holding an enquiry.  I am of the  firm view  that  the  order  of  dismissal  from service  being  a  major  penalty, cannot be imposed in such a hasty manner without holding  an  enquiry  even  assuming  that  the  petitioner  had  not  given  any  explanation  within  the  stipulated  time.  Even  with  regard  to  the  submission  of  the  explanation,  it  is  disputed  by  the  petitioner  by  4 contending that he had submitted the explanation already.  When the  second  respondent  has  chosen  to  frame  charges  against  the  petitioner, then in all fairness, he is bound to hold an enquiry and  finally pass the order based upon the outcome of the enquiry. 9.  Therefore,  in  my considered  view the  impugned order  cannot be sustained and therefore the same has to be set aside and  the  matter  has to be remitted back to  the second respondent for  holding an enquiry after giving sufficient opportunity to the petitioner  in accordance with law.    10. As the petitioner was 54 years age at the time of filing  of the writ petition, he had attained the age of superannuation during  the  pendency  of  the  writ  petition  and  therefore  the  question  of  reinstatement into service does not arise in consequence of the order  passed in this writ petition.  Therefore, the impugned order is set aide  and the mater is remitted back to the second respondent for holding  enquiry and thereafter to pass appropriate orders in accordance with  law within a period of two months from the date of receipt of a copy  of this order.  The writ petition is disposed of accordingly. No costs.    Index    : Yes         02.09.2013 Internet: Yes kk 5 K.RAVICHANDRABAABU,J.                                                   kk To 1.

Contemnor 2 Suo Motu  Contempt  Proceedings  initiated  against  the  Contemnor  herein as per  order  dated 05.08.2013 made in W.P.No.16321 of  2012. For Contemnor : Ms.V.M.Velumani, Spl.G.P. C O M  M O N   O R D E R The petitioner has filed the writ petition to quash the charge  memo dated 20.10.2009 issued under Rule 17(b) of the Tamil Nadu  Civil  Services  (Discipline  and  Appeal)  Rules  and  to  direct  the  respondents to disburse all the pensionary and retirement benefits  and  arrears  thereof  to  the  petitioner  within  a  time  frame  with  interest at 18% per annum for delayed payment. 2.  The  petitioner  had  earlier  filed  W.P.No.15101  of  2010  seeking  for  finalisation  of  the  disciplinary  proceedings  initiated  pursuant  to  the  charge  memo  dated  20.10.2009  within  a  time  frame.   This  Court  disposed  of  the  writ  petition  on  14.07.2010,  directing the first respondent to finalise the disciplinary proceedings  initiated under the charge memo dated 20.10.2009 and pass final  orders within a period of three months from the date of receipt of a  copy of the order. 3 3.  According  to  the  petitioner,  since  the  order  dated  14.07.2010 made in W.P.No.15101 of 2010 was not complied by  the respondents, the charge memo itself is liable to be quashed.  4.  The  respondents  neither  filed  an  application  seeking  extension of time to comply with the order passed by this Court nor  passed final order.  Hence, this Court initiated suo motu contempt  proceedings against the Director of Adi Dravidar and Tribal Welfare  Department, Chepauk, Chennai -5 on 05.08.2013 and directed the  matter to be listed today. 5. Pursuant to the contempt proceedings, the contemnor is  present  before  the  Court.  It  is  submitted  that  final  order  dated  27.08.2013  was  passed  on  the  disciplinary  proceedings.  Hence,  Suo Motu Contempt Petition No.1954 of 2013 is closed. 6. As far as the writ petition is concerned, I am not inclined to  agree  with  the  submission  made by the  learned counsel  for  the  petitioner that the charge memo is liable to be quashed as no final  order was passed in the disciplinary proceedings as directed by this  Court on 14.07.2010 in W.P.No.15101 of 2010. If the respondents  failed to comply with the order passed by this Court, the remedy  open to the petitioner is to file a contempt petition. The petitioner  4 cannot take advantage of the same and seek to quash the charge  memo itself. Further, now final order dated 27.08.2013 is passed on  the disciplinary proceedings to deduct a sum of Rs.200/- from the  pension  of  the  petitioner  for  a  period  of  one  year.  The  said  punishment  was  not  objected  by  the  petitioner.  Hence,  no  concurrence from TNPSC is necessary. 7.  In  these  circumstances,  nothing  survives  in  the  writ  petition. Hence, the writ  petition stands dismissed. However,  the  respondents are directed to settle the terminal benefits payable to  the petitioner at the earliest and in any event within a period of 12  weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.  No costs.  Consequently, connected miscellaneous petitions are closed. 02.09.2013 Index   : Yes/No Internet: Yes/No svki To 1.The District Adi Dravida Tribal Welfare Officer,   Collectorate Building,   Salem District, Salem. 2.The Special Tahsildar (ADW)   Salem.  5 D.HARIPARANTHAMAN, J. svki W.P.No.16321 of 2012 and Suo Motu Cont.P.No.1954 of 2013 02.09.2013 ",

Therefore,  the appellants due to enmity and with an intention of causing damage  to the house and cattle of  the Nachimuthu Gounder set  fire to the  Palmairah tree and it spread to the house of the Nachimuthu Gounder  and caused damage to the tune of Rs.1,10,000/- and therefore, the  appellants  are  liable  to  be  convicted  under  Section  436,  427  and  Section 4 (1) of TNPPD Act, 1992. 3.The  prosecution  examined  nine  witnesses  and  marked  six  3 exhibits.   On  the  defence  side  one  witness  was  examined  and  no  exhibits  were  marked.   The  prosecution  produced  and marked five  material objects. 4.The case of the prosecution is that on 31.03.2005 at about  3.30p.m., when P.W.1, his brother Karuppusamy and mother Velathaal  were in their house, they heard the sound of Subramania Gounder,  father of the appellants that the cow shed is burning and P.W.1 was  awakened by his brother and mother and when they saw the cow shed  burning, they immediately rescued the cows, oxes, sheep and in that  process the entire cow shed was damaged.  The fire spread to the  house of the P.W.1 and the bullock cart and articles found in the house  along with the house were burned to ashes.  On 01.04.2005 at about  2 p.m., they gave report before the police and the Inspector  of police  enquired about the occurrence and also asked about the persons who  set fire or against whom P.W.1 had any suspicion and two days later,  the  Inspector  of  Police  came  and  enquired  and  at  that  time,  P.W.1  informed  the  police  that  witnesses  Rasu,  Angamuthu,  Kathirvel  and  Ramachandran  informed  him  that  the  appellants set fire to his property due to enmity and therefore, they  have to be punished. 4 5.In  support  of  the  prosecution  case,  P.W.1,  his  brother  Karuppusamy P.W.2 and Ramachandran P.W.3 were examined.  P.W.4  is  the  Doctor  who  gave  treatment  to  P.W.1  and  P.W.5  is  the  observation mahazer witness P.W.6 is the photographer, P.W.7 is the  Head Constable who recorded the F.I.R. on the basis of the statement  given by P.W.1 and P.W.8 is the Doctor who treated P.W.1 and P.W.9  is the Inspector of Police who conducted investigation. 6.It is submitted by learned counsel appearing for the appellants  that as per the F.I.R., and as per the evidence of P.W.1, P.W.1 and 2  were  not  eye  witnesses  and  the  father  of  the  appellants  by  name  Subramania Gounder shouted that the cow shed was burning and only  after hearing his alarm, they went to the spot and found that the cow  shed was burning and they removed the cattle from the place and the  fire spread to the house and other properties and all the properties  were gutted.  He therefore, submitted that P.W.1 and P.W.2 did not  state that the appellants set fire.  P.W.3 Ramachandran was stated to  be the eye witness.  According to prosecution, P.W.1 and P.W.2 also  deposed that Ramachandran P.W.3 and three others informed that the  appellant set fire on that date.  He submitted that the evidence of  P.W.3 cannot be believed.  According to P.W.1 on 01.04.2005, when  he went to the police station to give the complaint, the Inspector of  5 police enquired about the persons who set fire or who was responsible  for the fire and at that time, he did not state the names of the persons  and the Inspector of Police came on 03.04.2005 and enquired him and  at that time, he informed that the appellants set fire and witnesses  Rasu,  Angamuthu,  Kathirvel  and  Ramachandran  saw that  and  they  informed the same to him.  P.W.3 the alleged eye witness stated in  chief examination that he saw the first accused/ first appellant carrying  a stick with cloth tied in the top and second appellant set fire to the  stick carried by the first appellant and they threw the stick with fire on  the  palmairah  tree  and  due  to  wind  which  was  blowing  towards  Western direction, the fire spread to the cow shed of P.W.1 and he  attempted to put of the fire and neighbours also came to that place  and all of them tried to put off the fire and they also attempted to use  compressor for spreading water and as there was electricity failure,  they were  not able  to put off  the fire  and two months later  police  enquired him and he told the happening to the police officer.  He did  not  state  that  he  informed  P.W.1  and  P.W.2  about  the  overtact  committed  by  the  appellants  namely,  throwing  the  fire  on  the  palmairah  tree.   It  is  further  stated  by  P.W.3  that  he  along  with  neighbours went to the place to put off the fire.  Therefore, it is seen  from the evidence of P.W.3 that P.W.3 was present during the relevant  time and he also attempted to put off the fire.  But he did not inform  6 P.W.1 of P.W.2 about the persons who was responsible for the fire.  The evidence of P.W.3 cannot also be believed for the reason that if  P.W.3  had  told  about  the  appellants  that  they  had  set  the  fire  immediately  after  the  occurrence  P.W.1  would  have  mentioned the  names of the appellants when he gave the F.I.R. on the next date.  He  therefore  submitted  reading  the  evidence  of  P.W.3  and  P.W.1,  it  cannot be stated that P.W.3 could be an eye witness and if P.W.3 were  an eye witness he would have informed P.W.1 about the persons who  set on fire to the property.  He therefore, submitted if P.W.3 cannot be  believed, there is no eye witness and admittedly, there was enmity  between the appellants and P.W.1 and P.W.2 and due to the enmity a  false  case  was  foisted  against  the  appellants  and  it  was  not  appreciated by the trial court.  He therefore submitted that the order  of the trial court has to be set aside.  7.The Learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted the second  appellant is dead and memo is also filed.  He submitted that P.W.1 and  P.W.2 were  not  eye  witnesses  regarding  the  setting  of  fire  by  the  appellants.  P.W.1 has stated that two days later he was informed by  P.W.3 and others that the appellants have set fire to the property and  that was also corroborated by P.W.3 in his evidence and there was no  necessity  for  P.W.3  to  give  false  evidence  against  the  appellants.  7 Considering the same fact in the appeal for various circumstances, it  does not call for any interference. 8.Having  regard  to  the  submissions  of  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellants  and  the  learned  Additional  Public  Prosecutor, we will have to see whether prosecution proved the case  beyond reasonable doubt against the appellants. 9.As stated supra, P.W.1 and P.W.2 did not state who set fire to  their property.  According to P.W.1 and P.W.2 two days later P.W.3  and other informed them that the appellants set fire to the property.  According to P.W.3, he and neighbours attempted to put off the fire  and  he  did  not  state  that  he  informed  P.W.1  or  P.W.2  about  the  persons who was responsible for the incident and according to him, he  was enquired by the Inspector of police two months later and at that  time, he informed about the involvement of the appellants.  As rightly  submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the appellants that if  P.W.3 had seen the appellants setting fire to palmairah tree and that  spread to the property of P.W.1 and he also attempted to put off the  fire  along with others,  definitely,  he would have informed P.W.1 of  P.W.2 about the persons who set on fire on their property.  Admittedly,  the F.I.R. Was given on the next day at 2.00 p.m., and according to  8 P.W.1,  he  was  enquired  by  Inspector  of  Police  while  recording  the  statement and registering the F.I.R.,  particularly  about  the persons  who set on fire or against whom he had any suspicion and he did not  name the persons who set on fire.",

By The Correspondent,     Tallakulam P.O., Madurai – 625 002.        .. Respondents Prayer:-   Writ  Petition  has  been  filed  under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution of India for issuance of Writ of Ceriorarified Mandamus  calling for the entire records relating to the above subject passed by  the 4th respondent  made in proceeding Nil.  Dated 19.12.1998 and  quash  the  same  and  consequently  direct  the  4th respondent  to  continue the Diocesan Pension Scheme which is more beneficial to the  petitioner  in  addition  to  the  other  benefits  as  per  the  E.P.F.  Act  Scheme  under  the  Employees  Provident  Fund  and  Miscellaneous  Provisions Act.  For Petitioner    : Mr.K.Chakarapani For Respondents 1 & 2 : Ms.V.J.Latha For Respondent 3 : Mr.A.Nixon For Respondent 4 : Mr.Sivam Sivanandraj - - - - - 2 O R D E R This writ petition is filed challenging the proceedings of the  4th respondent dated 19.12.1998 and consequently for a direction to  the  4th respondent  to  continue  the  Diocesan  Pension  Scheme  in  addition to the other benefits as per the provisions of the Employees  Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act, 1952.  2. The case of the petitioner is that she was appointed as a  Secondary  Grade  Assistant  in  the  4th respondent  school  on  23.06.1977.  The 4th respondent school introduced Diocesan Pension  Scheme with effect from 01.06.1974 and as per the said scheme, the  staff who have not reached 50 years are eligible for admission to the  scheme and they should contribute 3% of the basic pay and Diocesan  should contribute double the amount.   After  the retirement of  the  employee, the pension fund would be utilised for paying the pension  at a particular rate. The petitioner  opted for the Diocesan Pension  Scheme and made contribution.  The Employees' Pension Scheme has  been  subsequently  introduced  in  the  4th respondent  school  on  16.11.1995 and all the employees were compelled to join the said  scheme by making contribution to the said fund.  Consequently, the  Diocesan  Pension  Scheme  was  withdrawn  with  effect  from  01.04.1998, by the impugned proceedings dated 19.12.1998.  Thus,  aggrieved against the same, the present writ petition has been filed.   3 3. The grievance of the petitioner is that Diocesan Pension  Scheme  should  not  be  withdrawn  and  it  should  be  continued  in  addition  to  the  Employees  Pension  Scheme  available  under  the  Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions Act.  It is  an admitted fact that Diocesan Pension Scheme is not formulated in  pursuance  to  any  enactment.   It  is  also  seen  that  a  similar  writ  petition filed by another staff of the 4th respondent school challenging  the very same impugned order came to be dismissed by a learned  single Judge of this Court on 05.10.2009 in W.P.No.10145 of 2002.  The learned Judge has observed that what was sought to be enforced  is  a  scheme  said  to  have  been  floated  by  the  third  respondent  management  therein,  admittedly,  not  in  pursuance  of  any  enactment.  Therefore, the learned Judge has observed that the same  cannot be enforced by way of a writ petition.  It is seen that the said  order has not been set aside so far and as such the same is binding  on the parties.   4. No doubt, the learned counsel for the petitioner wants  this Court  to take a different view by relying on a decision of the  Calcutta High Court in Shalimar Paints H.O. Employees Union Vs.  Shalimar Paints Ltd., reported in  1981 I L.L.J.  471 to contend  that both schemes can be simultaneously implemented.  A perusal of  4 the  said  judgment  would  show  that  the  employees  therein  on  retirement were entitled for pension payable in terms of settlement  and therefore the Court held that under the settlement, payment of  Gratuity  was  not  an  alternative  to  the  payment  of  pension  and  therefore the employees who are entitled for pension on retirement  are  also  entitled  to  an  additional  benefit  of  payment  of  minimum  amount of gratuity as prescribed by the said Act.     5. Certainly the facts are totally different and distinguishable  in the case before the Calcutta High Court.  It is seen that based on  the settlement arrived at between the employer and employees they  were given some benefits which the Court found that the same is  liable to be continued as an additional benefit of payment of minimum  amount of gratuity as prescribed by such enactment.  As already cited  supra, the Diocesan Pension Scheme was not in pursuance to any  enactment and therefore based on that, the petitioner cannot seek  any relief for continuing the same in addition to the pension scheme  under the Employees Provident Funds and Miscellaneous Provisions  Act.   When  admittedly,  the  petitioner  had  joined  the  subsequent  scheme  introduced  by  the  said  Act,  then  she  cannot  compel  the  management to continue the old scheme also.   5 6. In view of the above stated facts and circumstances as  well as in view of the fact that a similar prayer was rejected by this  Court in W.P.No.10145 of 2002 dated 05.10.2009, I find no merit in  the writ petition and the same is accordingly dismissed.

For Petitioner    :  Mr.G.Shivasurya For Respondents   :  Mr.V.Subbiah, Spl.Govt.Pleader O R D E R The petitioner  was appointed as  Grade I  Constable in the Police  Department.  He  was  promoted  as  Special  Sub-Inspector  of  Police  and  posted at B3 Traffic Kattur Police Station, Coimbatore City. 2 2. While so, a case was registered in Crime No.20/2013 on the file  of Perur Police Station, Coimbatore District, under Sections 294(b), 323,  427 and 506(ii) of IPC against the petitioner on the allegation that the  petitioner along with Sundarajan and Natarajan had beaten the defacto  complainant Meenatchi Sundaram and damaged the glass bottles of his  petty shop and caused simple hurt.  3.  In these circumstances, the petitioner obtained anticipatory bail  from this Court by an order dated 13.02.2013 in Crl.O.P.No.2855 of 2013.  4.  Based  on  the  registration  of  the  aforesaid  criminal  case,  the  second  respondent  passed  the  impugned  suspension  order  dated  13.02.2013  under  Rule  3(e)(1)(i)&(ii)   of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Police  Subordinate Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules, 1955 (for short TNPSS  (D & A) Rules).  5. The order of suspension is under challenge in this writ petition. 6.  Heard both sides. 7. The learned counsel  for the petitioner has submitted that the  petitioner was not arrested and remanded to custody, and therefore, there  was no necessity to place him under suspension.  It is further submitted  that paying subsistence allowance from tax payers money would cause  3 loss  to  the  Government  exchequer  and  therefore,  he  prayed  that  the  suspension of the petitioner may be revoked and he could be transferred  to a faraway place.  8.  The  petitioner  has  relied  on  the  following  judgments  of  this  Court:- i) The Deputy Inspector General of Police, Coimbatore Range  v. S.Govindaraj [2012 (1) CTC 124] ii)  R.Gunasekaran,  Sub-Inspector  of  Police  v.  The  Deputy  Inspector  General  of  Police,  Thanjavur  Range,  [CDJ  2013  MHC  713] 9. I have considered the submissions made by the learned counsel  for the petitioner. 10. It is necessary to extract clause 3 (e)(1) & (2) of TNPSS       (D  & A) Rules:- \"3(e)(1) A member of a service may be placed under  suspension from service,where- (i)  an  enquiry  into  grave  charges   against  him  is  contemplated or is pending, or (ii) a complaint against him of any criminal offence is  under  investigation  or  he  is  under  trial  and  if  such  suspension is necessary in the public interest. (2)A member of a service who is detained in custody  whether on a criminal charge or otherwise, for a period  longer than forty eight hours shall be deemed to have  4 been suspended under this rule.\" 11. The petitioner was not placed under suspension invoking clause  3(e)(2) of the TNPSCC (D & A) Rules. Only the said rule contemplates  placing an employee under suspension if he was detained in custody for  more than forty eight hours.  Hence, the submission made in this regard  by the learned counsel for the petitioner has no substance. 12.  As  per  the affidavit  filed in support  of  the writ  petition,  the  petitioner was placed under suspension for his involvement in the criminal  case in Crime No.20/13 under Sections 294(b), 323, 427 and 506(ii) of  IPC on the file of Perur Police Station, Coimbatore District.  13. It is stated in the suspension order that public interest requires  to  place  the  petitioner  under  suspension.    The  petitioner  was  placed  under suspension invoking Rule  3(e)(1)(i)&(ii) of TNPSS (D & A) Rules.  The  said Rule  contemplates  to  place  an employee under  suspension if  complaint against him of any criminal offence is under investigation or he  is under trial and if such suspension is necessary in the public interest. 14. Further, the petitioner is a Special Sub-Inspector belonging to  Uniformed  service.  A  criminal  case  is  registered  against  him.   The  allegation made against him was that he had caused damage to the petty  shop of the defacto complainant and caused simple hurt. 5 15. Therefore,  I am of the view that there is no infirmity in the  impugned  order  of  suspension.   However,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  vehemently  contended  by placing reliance  on  the  judgments  referred to above. 16.  The  decisions  relied  on  by  the  petitioner  are  dealt  with  hereunder:- i)  In  the  Deputy  Inspector  General  of  Police,  Coimbatore  Range v.  S.Govindaraj  [2012 (1) CTC 124],  the respondent was a  Head Constable. He was kept under suspension invoking Rule 3(e)(1)(ii)  of TNPSS (D & A) Rules based on the criminal case registered against him  under Section 7 of Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.  The charge against  him was that he collected bribe from the complainant one Ponnuswamy for  return of his vehicle.  He was placed under suspension by order dated  06.09.2006.  In those circumstances, the learned single Judge allowed the  writ petition on 27.08.2009 on the ground that the petitioner was under  suspension for more than three years. ii)  The  State  filed  writ  appeal.  While  admitting  the  writ  appeal,  interim stay of the order of the learned single Judge was granted and the  same was also made absolute.   iii) Taking into account the fact that the delinquent therein was kept  under suspension for five years and also the fact that the name of the  delinquent therein did not find place in the FIR and that the allegation of  6 demanding  bribe  was  made  against  the  Sub-Inspector  of  Police,  the  Division Bench did not interfere with the order of the learned single Judge  and  dismissed  the  writ  appeal.  The  Division  Bench  noted  that  the  respondent therein has been kept under prolonged suspension for a period  of nearly 5 years and investigation was already over and charge sheet was  also filed and one prosecution witness was examined at that time. 17. In the case on hand, the petitioner was placed suspension only  on  13.02.2013.  The  stage  of  the  investigation  of  the  criminal  case,  wherein, the petitioner was arrayed an accused, is not stated.  Hence, the  aforesaid judgment cannot be of any use to the petitioner and the same  cannot be applied to the facts of this case. 18. In the judgment in R.Gunasekaran, Sub-Inspector of Police  v. The Deputy Inspector General of Police, Thanjavur Range, [CDJ  2013 MHC 713], referred to by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the  petitioner therein was a Sub-Inspector of Police. While he was on duty at  Poraiyar Police Station, on 24.11.2009, one Aruldhas, gave a complaint  that  the  petitioner  therein  demanded  bribe.  The  Vigilance  and  Anti  Corruption  department  registered  a  case  in  Crime  No.12/2009  under  Sections  7,  13(1)(d)  read  with  Section  13(2)  of  the  Prevention  of  Corruption Act, 1988. He was kept under suspension for three years. In  these circumstances, taking into account the fact that the petitioner was  kept under suspension for more than three years, the writ petition was  disposed of on 28.11.2012 directing the respondent department therein to  7 post the petitioner in a non-sensitive post. Further, the authorities were  also directed to reexamine the issue and to place the petitioner therein  under  suspension  if  the  authorities  were  of  the  opinion  that  his  continuance in service would cause hindrance to the proceedings.  18 (i) Paragraph 8 of the said judgment is extracted hereunder:- \"8.In such circumstances, in view of the earlier orders  passed  by  this  Court,  cited  supra,  the  impugned  proceedings of  the respondent,  dated 04.12.2009, is  set aside and the respondent is directed to post the  petitioner in a far away place from the station, in which  the  occurrence  is  alleged  to  have  taken  place,  in  a  non-sensitive post. It is made it clear that, if for some  reason,  the authorities concerned  are of  the opinion  that his continuance in service is a hindrance to the  proceedings  initiated   against  him,  they  could  re- examine the issue and they would be at liberty to take  appropriate action against the petitioner and to pass  orders, as per law.\" 18 (ii) In the last two lines of paragraph 5 of the judgment, this  Court has held that the writ petition is liable to be dismissed. The said  lines are extracted hereunder:- \"As  such,  the  contentions  raised  on  behalf  of  the  petitioner are devoid of merits, and therefore, this Writ  Petition is liable to be dismissed.\" 8 18 (iii) Taking into account the fact that the petitioner therein has  been kept under suspension for three years, this Court issued a direction  as stated above.",

Petitioner  -vs- The State of Tamil Nadu represented by the Deputy Commercial Tax Officer, Harbour II Assessment Circle, Chennai-1.         ... Respondent  Tax Case (Revision) filed under Section 38 of the Tamil  Nadu  General  Sales  Tax  Act,  1959  to  revise  the  order  of  the  Sales  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal  (Additional  Bench),  Chennai  dated  21.03.2003  in  TA.No.517 of 2000.  For Petitioner : Mr.N.Inbarajan For Respondent           :        Mr.A.R.Jayapratap, G.A (Taxes) O R D E R (Order of the Court was made by CHITRA VENKATARAMAN, J.) The  above  Tax  Case  Revision  is  filed  at  the  instance  of  the  assessee as against the order of the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal for  2 the  assessment  year  1994-95.  The  above  Tax  Case  Revision  was  admitted on the following substantial questions of law: (i)In the facts and circumstances of the case, whether  the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal is right in levying tax in  respect  of  the  goods  involved  in  the  execution  of  works  contract, which are purchased in the course of inter state  sales? (ii)In the facts and circumstances of the case, whether  the Tribunal is right in confirming the levy of penalty under  Section 22(2) of the TNGST Act? 2.The  assessee/petitioner  herein  is  a  dealer  in  diesel  engine  generators  and  they  are  carrying  on  the  job  work  of  erection  and  commissioning of diesel engine generators. It is seen from the facts  narrated  that  the  assessee  had  a  work  contract  with  the  Telecommunication  department,  Government  of  India  for  supply,  installation, testing, commissioning of diesel generating set. The work  was undertaken as a continuous process, resulting in payments made  partly on supply of diesel generating sets and on installation, testing  and commissioning and the balance on completion of warranty period.  On completion of the work and on installation, the petitioner raised bill  and paying tax on 70% of  the receipts made by them. They claim  exemption on 30% towards labour charges. Based on the inspection  3 made by the Enforcement Authorities, the Assessing Officer verified all  the sales invoices raised by the assessee and found that the dealer  effected  sales  to  the  Government  department  to  the  tune  of  Rs.43,96,018/- and reported only 70% of the said amount as taxable  turnover in the monthly returns filed by them for the assessment year  1994-95. Thus, the Assessing Officer allowed the exemption claimed at  30%  towards  labour  charges  and  determined  total  and  taxable  turnover and levied tax. In the assessment order, the Assessing Officer  also found that the dealer collected 12% sales tax as against 4% on  the  sales  to  the  Government  department.  As  such,  the  Assessing  Officer proposed to levy penalty under Section 22(2) of the Tamil Nadu  General  Sales  Tax  Act.  After  hearing  the  assessee's  objection,  the  Assessing Officer confirmed the assessment.                      3.Aggrieved by this,  the  assessee  went  on  appeal  before  the  Appellate  Assistant  Commissioner  of  Commercial  Taxes,  who  found  that  the  assessee  had  charged  separately  for  labour  charges  and  separately  for  the  supply  of  materials.  The  assessee  had  also  undertaken  supply  on  fixing  up  of  exhaust  pipes,  fuel  pipes  and  thermal installation, over spread relay etc. In the circumstances, the  First Appellate Authority found that after allowing 30% towards labour  4 charges,  taxable  turnover  determined by  the  Assessing  Officer  was  correct.  Apart  from  that,  the  First  Appellate  Authority,  while  considering  the  claim of  the  assessee  for  exemption under  Section  3(B) (2-a), held that when the assessee had not produced any proof to  the  effect  that  they  purchased the  entire  materials  involved  in  the  execution of works contract from outside the State, the question of  grant  of  exemption  did  not  apply.  Thus,  the  appeal  filed  by  the  assessee was rejected.  4.Aggrieved by this,  the  assessee  went  on  appeal  before  the  Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, which confirmed the order of the First  Appellate  Authority.  The Tribunal pointed out that on verification of  sales invoices raised by the assessee, the Assessing Officer found the  turnover of Rs.42,36,665/- representing cost of materials supplied on  works contract and rightly determined the taxable turnover and levied  tax. As regards the claim of deduction under Section 3-B (2-a), the  Tribunal held that there was no material to show that the assessee had  purchased the entire materials in execution of the works contract from  outside the State, to claim deduction under Section 3-B (2-a). Thus,  the  Tribunal  confirmed  the  assessment.  As  regards  penalty  under  Section 22(2) of the Act, the Tribunal also confirmed the same. Hence,  the assessee filed the present Tax Case Revision before this Court. 5 5.Learned counsel appearing for the assessee/petitioner herein  submitted  that  the  assessee  had  purchased  the  entire  materials  involved in the execution of works contract from outside the State. As  such,  the  assessee's  claim  for  exemption  under  Section  3(B)(2-a)  cannot be rejected. We do not accept the submission made by the  learned counsel for the assessee, in the absence of any material to  substantiate  the  same.  The  assessee  has  no  where  stated  in  the  appeal grounds or in reply that the work contract was executed from  outside the State of Tamil Nadu and they purchased the materials and  other connected parts and accessories from other States only for the  purpose of job work undertaken by them with the Telecommunication  department. In the circumstances, there was absolutely no material to  substantiate the claim for deduction under Section 3-B (2-a) and the  same was rightly rejected by the authorities concerned. We do not find  any justifiable reason to interfere with the order of the Tribunal in this  regard.  6.As far as the levy of penalty under section 22(2) is concerned,  admittedly the assessee charged sales tax at 12% as against 4% on  sales to the Government department. Thus, the Tribunal held that the  levy of penalty was in accordance with the provisions of law. In the  6 circumstances, we do not find any reason to interfere with the order of  the Tribunal. Consequently, the Tax Case Revision stands dismissed.  No costs. (C.V.,J)   (K.B.K.V.,J) 23.08.2013 rk Index:Yes/No Internet:Yes/No To 1.

Respondents in OSA No.111/2009 Original Side Appeals filed under  Order XXXVI Rule 1 of the Original  Side Rules, 1956,  read with Clause 15 of the Letters Patent against the  common order dated 24.06.2008 passed in O.P.Nos.621,622, 623 of 2003,  218 of 2004 and 616 of 2007. For appellants :  Mr.M.K.Kabir in all OSAs.    Senior Advocate  for    Mr.A.Dhiraviyanathan    Ms.M.Padmavathy For first  respondent   : Mr.A.Abdul Hameed in all OSAs.   COMMON JUDGMENT M.M.SUNDRESH,J.  Original Side Appeal Nos.107, 108 and 111 of 2009 have been filed  by the appellants, who  were the petitioners in O.P.Nos.621, 622 and 616  of 2007. O.S.A.Nos.109 and 110 of 2009 have been filed by the petitioners  in O.P.Nos.623 of 2003 and 218 of 2004.  4 2. The appellants in all these appeals are run by the same group of  persons and the contesting respondent is one and the same.   The issues  involved  both on fact  and law are also the same.  Therefore, they are  disposed of by way of a common order. 3. The facts in brief: 3.1  M/s Harita Finance Limited entered into two lease agreements  with the appellants  in the year 1995 and 1996 respectively.  As per the  lease deeds certain machineries were  let on lease to the appellants.  The  Directors of the appellants  stood as guarantors.   3.2.  By two deeds of  Assignment   dated 17.07.1998,   M/s Harita  Finance Limited  assigned  all its rights in favour of the first respondent.  These deeds of  assignment were also signed by the appellants and its  guarantors.  It was agreed that the outstanding  amounts would be paid as  per the revised payment schedule mentioned therein. 3.3. The appellants committed default.  The first respondent entered  into  two  separate  loan  agreements  with  the  appellants  on  31.12.2000.  According  to  the  said  agreements,  the  loan  amounts  were  adjusted  towards part of the outstanding amounts payable by the appellants.  The  5 appellants in O.S.A.No.107 of 2009  filed an application before the BIFR.  On  16.08.2001,  a  Memorandum  of  Understanding  was  entered  into  between  the  M/s  Harita  Finance  Limited  and  the  first  appellant  in  all  appeals viz., Terry Gold (India) Limited (O.S.A.Nos.107, 108 and 111 of  2009) and Goldwon Textiles Limited, (O.S.A.Nos.109 and 110 of 2009), by  which, an one time settlement was arrived at and it was agreed that the  specified amount would be  payable by the  first appellant.   As per the  same, the first appellant in O.S.A.No.107 of 2009 was to allot 19,00,000  equity shares of Rs.10/- each, with the understanding that they could be  bought back after due discharge of the payment due.  It was also agreed  between the parties that  in case of breach, the first respondent would be  entitled to revert back to the original status and make a claim for the entire  amount due. 3.4. As there was a failure on the part of the  appellants, the  first  respondent terminated the Memorandum of Understanding and claimed the  money due in terms of the Deeds of Assignment.  As the appellants did not  make the  payments,  the  first  respondent  invoked the  arbitration  clause  contained in the Deeds of Assignment. 3.5.  The learned Arbitrator, by a well reasoned order,  rejected the  issue of  maintainability  raised  by  the  appellants.   It  was raised  on  the  6 ground that  the money due can only be claimed by the first respondent  under the Memorandum of Understanding  alone  and not the Deeds of  Assignment.   A further  contention was raised that  the only issue to  be  decided is as to whether the first respondent can claim for allotment of  shares or not and therefore, the question of payment of money can never  be raised. 3.6. Challenging the arbitration  awards, the appellants filed Original  petitions before this Court  invoking the power under Section 34  of  the  Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996. The learned single Judge dismissed  the  petitions.  O.P.No.616  of  2007  has  been  filed  by  the  appellant  in  O.S.A.No.111 of 2009 challenging the Arbitration Case No.5 of 2003, by  which,  the  Arbitrator  was  appointed  as  per  the  Memorandum  of  Understanding dated 16.08.2001.  The subject matter of the said case is as  to whether the termination of Memorandum of Understanding is valid or  not.   Challenging  the  orders  passed  by  the  learned  single  Judge,  the  appellants have filed these appeals before us. 4.  Heard the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants  and the learned counsel appearing for the first respondent.  We have also  perused the  documents  filed  as  well  as  the  written  submissions of  the  appellants. 7 5. Submissions of the Appellants:- The learned  Senior counsel appearing for the appellants submitted  that   as per  the lease agreement,  two Arbitrators  ought  to have been  appointed.   It  is  further  submitted  that  the  unilateral  appointment  of  an  Arbitrator, at the instance of the first respondent, cannot be sustained in  the eye of law.  The first respondent being an assignee, cannot seek for the  amount more than  that  is  due to the assignor.    The Memorandum of  Understanding was  entered into  between the parties and the further loan  was paid after  initiation  of the proceedings before the BIFR and therefore,  the same is not sustainable in law.    In  support  of  his contention,  the  learned counsel has made reliance upon the judgment   in  NARAYAN  PRASAD LOHIA V. NIKUNJ KUMAR  LOHIA (AIR 2002 Supreme Court  1139) etc. 6. Submissions of the  first Respondent:-  Per contra, the  learned  counsel appearing for the first  respondent,  would submit that the appellants seek to raise new grounds for the first  time before this Court.   Neither in the proceedings before the  arbitration  nor before the learned single Judge such a contention  has been raised.  Even in the grounds of Appeal no such contention has been raised.  The  first respondent is not claiming any amount higher than what is due.  The  8 Assignment Deeds  have taken note of the interest and the subsequent  amount payable.  The appellants have admitted the dues to be payable by  signing the Deeds of Assignment  and the Memorandum of Understanding.  The appellants cannot take conflicting stands.  They cannot approbate and  re-probate.  There is no law which prohibits the payment of loan pending  an application  before the BIFR.  The conduct of the appellants also do not  warrant  any  interference  as  notwithstanding  the  loan  agreement  dated  31.12.2000 and the Memorandum of Understanding, they did not make any  payment.",

These Original Side Appeals have been preferred by the appellant,  being aggrieved against the  dismissal of  Original Application Nos. 3564,  3565  and 3566  of 2009  in C.S.No.85 of 2008 and allowing  O.A.No.989  of 2008  in C.S.No.85 of 2008, vide, order dated 15.03.2012.   2. Facts in brief: 2.1.  Some of  the  suit  properties  are  situated  within  the  territorial  jurisdiction of  this Court and some  outside of it.  Alleging that the suit  properties are  the   joint  family properties,  the appellant  filed a suit  in  C.S.No.85 of 2008 seeking partition and separate possession.  At the time  of presentation of the plaint, it was filed along with an application seeking  leave to sue. The Registry has returned the plaint as well as the application  filed seeking leave.  However, the appellant made an endorsement stating  that  no  leave is  required  and consequently,  she  did  not  re-present  the  application seeking leave.  The suit was duly numbered. 4 2.2. The first respondent, who is the father of the appellant, filed an  application in Application  No.989 of 2008 in C.S.No.85 of 2008 seeking to  reject  the plaint.   The appellant,  in  turn,  filed  applications  in   Original  Application  Nos.3564,  3565  and  3566  of  2009  in  C.S.No.85  of  2008  seeking leave to institute the suit, to condone  the defective presentation of  the plaint  without obtaining the leave under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent  and to condone the delay of 297 days in representing  the leave to sue  application  in Diary No.1627 of 2008 respectively.  2.3. The learned single Judge,  by an elaborate  order, dismissed the  applications filed by the appellant and allowed the application filed by the  first  respondent  herein.  Aggrieved  against  the  said  common  order,  the  appellant has come before us. 3. Submissions of the Appellant:- The learned counsel appearing for the appellant would submit  that the defect is a curable one.  The appellant  has not re-presented  the  plaint  as  she  was under  the  misconception  that  no  such  application  is  required.  The learned single judge ought to have allowed the applications  considering the scope and ambit of Clause 12 of the Letters Patent.  The  suit  being  one  for  partition,  the  cause  of  action   is  a  continuing  one.  Therefore, the appeals will have to be allowed. 5 4. Submissions of the Respondents:- Per contra, the learned counsel appearing for the respondents  would submit that admittedly the appellant has not sought for leave. For the  reasons known to her she did not press the application filed for seeking  leave.  She filed the application thereafter when the suit was numbered and  when the first respondent has filed an application under Order VII Rule 11  of the Civil Procedure Code.  The suit as filed  is not maintainable in law  and facts.   When  some of  the suit  properties are situated outside the  jurisdiction of this Court,  a leave is mandatory.  Therefore, there is no merit  in the appeals and accordingly, they should be rejected. 5. DISCUSSION:- 5.1. It is not in dispute that under Clause 12 of the Letters Patent,  when  some  of  the  suit  properties  are  situated  out  of  the  territorial  jurisdiction of this Court, leave ought to have been obtained.  The learned  counsel  appearing for the appellant  has also fairly accepted the settled  position of law.  Perhaps that is the reason why the appellant has filed the  applications  during the pendency of the suit.  In the case on hand, the  appellant  did  file an application seeking leave.  However, for the reasons  known  to  her, she did not re-present the said application,  but  managed 6 to number the suit.  In such a situation, the applications filed pending the  suit  by the  appellant  are  not  maintainable  in  law.   When  a  leave  is  a  condition precedent, the same cannot be cured thereafter.  Therefore, in  such view of the matter, we do not find any error in the orders passed by  the learned single Judge dismissing the applications filed by the appellant  and consequently allowing the application filed by the first respondent.   5.2. However, we find force in the submission made by the learned  counsel appearing for the appellmant that the suit as filed being one for  partition and separate possession, the cause of action is a continuous one.  Further  more,  a  party  is  entitled  to  file  a  separate  suit  by  way  of  a  presentation of  the plaint  on the very same cause of  action,  when the  earlier  one was rejected under Order VII  Rule 1 of  the Civil  Procedure  Code  as  per  the   provision  contained  in  Order  VII  Rule  13.   Hence,  considering the facts and circumstances of the case and taking note of the  scope and ambit of Order VII Rule 13 of the Civil Procedure Code, while  dismissing these Original Side Appeals, we grant liberty to the appellant to  file a fresh suit on the very same cause of action as shown in the plaint in  C.S.No.85  o   2008.  Accordingly,  all  these  Original  Side  Appeals  are  dismissed giving liberty to the appellant to file a fresh suit in  accordance with law on the very same cause of action as shown in the  7 plaint in C.S.No.85 of 2008.  No costs.

Appellant  Vs. 1.Dr.Mr.Tulsi Ram 2.Krishnan ... Respondents Origin al Side Appeal filed under  Order XXXVI Rule 9 of the Original  Side Rules, 1956,  read with Clause 15 of the Letters Patent against the  order dated 15.06.2012  in Application No.5822 of 2011 in C.S.No.46 of  2011. For appellant :  Mr.G.Rajagopal,    Senior Counsel for     Mr.S.Sundaresan For  respondents  : Mr.T.V.Ramanujam,    Senior Counsel for   Mr.Biju for    M/s Fox Mandal & Associates, for R1    No appearance for R2 2 JUDGMENT M.M.SUNDRESH,J. The  appellant, who is the plaintiff in C.S.No.46 of 2011, has filed the  above Original Side Appeal challenging the order dated 15.06.2012 passed  in   Application  No.5822  of  2011  in  C.S.No.46  of  2011,  by  which,  the  learned single  Judge was pleased  to  refer  the  dispute  to  the  learned  Arbitrator  in  terms  of  Clause  23  of  Development  Agreement  dated  27.03.2006 entered into between the parties. 2.Facts in Brief: 2.1.  The  respondent  herein  is  the  owner  of  the  property.   A  Development Agreement was entered into between the appellant and the  respondent  on 27.03.2006.  As per the said Development Agreement, it  was agreed  between the  parties  that  the  respondent  would  get  certain  quantified plots after completion. Clause 17 of the agreement speaks about  a remedy  for breach of agreement.  As per the said clause,   in the event  of  one  of  the  parties  committing  breach  of  any  of  the  terms  of  the  agreement,  the other shall be entitled to specific performance  apart from  losses and damages.   Clause 23 of  the said agreement  deals with the  arbitration, according to which all disputes arising between the parties from  or out of the terms  of the agreement shall be  resolved by the arbitration.  The said Clause once again reiterates the fact  that the aggrieved party  3 entitled to claim specific performance, liquidated damages, injunctions and  the like.   2.2. As there was a dispute between the parties in the interpretation  of their respective allotments of plots/villas, OSR area, extent of site, etc., a  Supplemental Agreement was entered into between them on 17.02.2009.  It is to be noted that even in the original agreement, it was agreed between  the  parties  that   the  villas  ear-marked  for  them  will  be  identified  and  finalised  by entering into a subsequent Supplemental Agreement.   Clause  11 of a Supplemental Agreement  states that all other terms and conditions  and specifications of the earlier agreement  dated 27.03.2006 shall remain  in  force  and  the  subsequent  deed  shall  not  affect  the  legality  or  enforceability  thereof.   2.3. Since a dispute has  arisen between the parties, the appellant  filed a suit in C.S.No.46 of 2011 seeking specific  performance against the  respondents.   During the pendency of  the suit,  the respondent  filed an  application in Application No.5822 of 2011 in C.S.No.46 of 2011 to refer  the dispute along with the suit to the learned Arbitrator as per the Clause  23  contained  in  the  Development  Agreement  dated  27.03.2006.   The  learned  single  judge  was  pleased  to  allow  the  application  filed  by  the  respondent.   The learned single Judge, after making reliance upon  the  4 decision of the Honourable Apex Court, was pleased to hold that a conjoint  reading of Clause 23 of the Development  Agreement dated 27.03.2006  and Clause 11 of  Supplemental Agreement dated 17.02.2009 would lead  to the irresistible conclusion that the arbitration clause subsists between  the  parties and therefore, they have to resolve their dispute only through  the  said  mechanism.  Challenging  the  same,  the  present  Original  Side  Appeal has been filed. 3. Submissions of the appellant: The  learned  Senior  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellant  would  submit that  the relief for specific performance cannot be granted by the  learned  Arbitrator.   There  is  no  arbitration  clause  in  the  Supplemental  Agreement.  In the absence of  any specific  clause for arbitration in the  Supplemental Agreement, the suit is maintainable in law.  Even though the  document has been mentioned as a  Supplemental Agreement, it is only a  settlement entered into between the parties through the conciliation.  The  learned Senior Counsel further submits that the appeal is maintainable  as  this Court can exercise  the very same powers  as of the first instance.  Therefore,  the   appeal  will  have  to  be  allowed.    In  support  of  his  contention,  the  learned  Senior  counsel  has  made  reliance  upon  the  following Judgements. (i) BEEBROS  PROPERTY  DEVELOPMENT  PVT.  LTD.,  VANISRI AND ANOTHER (2008) 4 CTC 275;  5 (ii) MD.ARMY WELFARE HOUSING  ORGANISATION V. SUMANGAL  SERVICES  (P)   LTD., (2004) 9 Supreme  Court  Cases  619;  and (iii) BADDULA  LAKSHMAIAH   &  OTHERS  V.  SRI   ANJANEYA SWAMI TEMPLE & OTHERS  (1996)   2 LAW WEEKLY 8. 4. Submissions of the Respondent: Per contra,   learned Senior counsel  appearing for the respondent  would  submit  that  it  is  highly  doubtful  as  to  whether  the  appeal  is  maintainable in view of the expressed bar contained  in Section 37 of the  Arbitration and Conciliation Act,1996.  Even on  merits, the appellant does  not  have  a  case.   The  subsequent  agreement  is  only  a  Supplemental  Agreement and the said agreement was  entered into between the parties  to resolve the dispute regarding the interpretation of respective allotments  of plots/villas, OSR area,  site etc.  Therefore, there is no dispute regarding  the  arbitration  clause  contained in  the  earlier  agreement.   The learned  single  Judge  has  rightly  construed  Clause  11  of  the  Supplemental  Agreement  in  consonance  with  the  agreement  dated  27.03.2006  which  contains the arbitration clause.  It is not correct to state that the learned  arbitrator does not have the power to grant the relief sought for.  When the  principal  agreement  contains  the arbitration clause,  the same would be  made  applicable  to  the  Supplemental  Agreement  also.  Therefore,  the  6 appeal will have to be dismissed as devoid of merits.  In support of his  contention,  the  learned  Senior  Counsel  has  made  reliance  upon  the  following Judgements.   (i) KOTAK MAHINDRA INVESTMENT LTD. V. KITPLY  INDUSTRIES LIMITED AND ANOTHER  (AIR 2012  CALCUTTA 24); and  (ii) M/S MARUTI CLEAN COAL & POWER  LIMITED V.  KOLAHAI  INFOTECH  PVT.  LTD.  AND  OTHERS  dated 06.05.2010 (Delhi High Court). (iii) CHLORO CONTROLS (I) P. LIMITED V. SEVERN  TRENT WATER PURIFICATION INC. AND OTHERS  (2013) 1 CTC 418(SC) 5. DISCUSSION:- 5.1.  Even though the learned Senior counsel appearing for the first  respondent raised the question of maintainability of the appeal before us by  placing reliance upon  Section 37 of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,  1996,  we do not propose to go into the same as we are of the view that the  appeal  deserves  to  be  dismissed  even  on  merits.    In  so  far  as  the  contention  of the learned Senior counsel appearing for the appellant that  the  agreement  dated  17.02.2009  is  a  Supplemental  Agreement   and  therefore, it is executable, the same deserves to be rejected as devoid of  merits.  The Supplemental Agreement  dated 17.02.2009  clearly states  the  reasons  for  which  it  has  been  executed  between  the  parties.  A  7 conciliation would come under Part  3 of the Arbitration and Conciliation  Act,1996.   Part III of the said Act provides for a mechanism with its own  procedure while dealing with the conciliation.  We do not find any reason to  hold  that  the  Supplemental  Agreement  is  a  settlement  agreement  as  contended by the learned Senior  Counsel   appearing for  the appellant.  Merely because there is  a  reference in  Clause 8 of  the  Supplemental  Agreement regarding the placement  of gas cylinders as recommended by  Mr. Kapil Chitale, the same would not amount to conciliation at his behest.  Even the said clause would be contrary  to the contention of the learned  Senior counsel appearing for the appellant  as it can only be confined to  the placement  of  gas cylinders and further  more,  it  only deals  with the  recommendation.",

I have heard Mr.A.Navaneethakrishnan, learned Advocate General  assisted  by  Mr.E.Sampath  Kumar,  learned  Special  Government  Pleader  (Education),  Mr.AR.L.Sundaresan,  learned  Senior  Counsel  for  the  first  respondent  (AICTE),  Mr.A.S.Chakravarthy,  learned  Central  Government  Standing  Counsel  for  respondents  2  and  3  and  Mr.K.Doraisamy,  learned  Senior  Counsel  for  the  fourth  respondent  impleaded  by  order  dated  24.7.2011 in M.P.No.6 of 2011. 3 3. The All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) prescribed a  revised eligibility criteria for admission (i) to the 4 Year Bachelor's Degree  Program in Engineering Technology and (ii) by way of lateral entry to the  Second Year of 4 Year Bachelor's Program in Engineering and Technology for  the academic year 2011-2012. The eligibility criteria is indicated in Clause 1.1  and 1.2 of Appendix 1 of the Approval Process Hand Book released by AICTE.  The eligibility criteria reads as follows:- S.No. Program Duration Eligibility 1. Engineering  and  Technology 4 Years Passed  10+2  examination  with  Physics  and  Mathematics  as  compulsory subjects along with one  of  the  Chemistry/  Biotechnology/  Biology Obtained at least 50% marks (45%  in  case  of  candidate  belonging  to  reserved  category)  in  the  above  subjects taken together. 2. Engineering  and  Technology Lateral  entry  to  second  year A Passed  Diploma  examination  from  an  AICTE  approved  institution; with at least 50% marks  (45%  in  case  of  candidates  belonging  to  reserved  category)  in  appropriate  branch  of  Engineering/  Technology. B Passed  B.Sc.,  Degree  from  a  recognised University as defined by  UGC, with at least 50% marks (45%  in  case  of  candidates  belonging to  reserved  category)  and  passed  XII  Standard  with  mathematics  as  a  subject. 4. Contending that the aforesaid revised eligibility criteria, would knock  the reserved category candidates out of the purview of Degree Courses in  4 Engineering and Technology and that huge number of seats in Engineering  Colleges  would go unfilled due to the revised eligibility criteria,  the State  Government has come up with the above writ petition. 5. Before proceeding to analyse the basis on which the State has come  up with the above writ petition, I must bring on record one fact. The writ  petition was admitted on 30.6.2011. Along with the writ petition, the State  filed 3 miscellaneous petitions, in M.P.Nos.1 to 3 of 2011. M.P.No.1 of 2011  was for dispensing with the production of the original impugned proceedings  of  the  AICTE.  M.P.No.2  of  2011 was for  interim stay of  operation of  the  impugned regulations. M.P.No.3 of 2011 was for an interim direction to allow  the  Selection  Committee  constituted  by  the  State  Government  to  grant  admission  as  per  the  norms  fixed  by  the  State  Government  in  G.O.Ms.No.151, Higher Education, dated 14.6.2010. 6.  While  admitting the  writ  petition on  30.6.2011,  P.Jyothimani,  J.,  granted an ex parte order of interim stay of the impugned regulations in  M.P.No.2 of 2011. The learned Judge also granted an interim direction ex  parte,  on the same day viz.,  30.6.2011 while admitting the writ  petition,  thereby permitting the State to admit students on the basis of the norms  fixed by the State Government in G.O.Ms.No.151, Higher Education, dated  14.6.2010. 7. Subsequently, the All India Council for Technical Education came up  with two miscellaneous petitions viz., M.P.Nos.4 and 5 of 2011. In M.P.No.4  of 2011, AICTE sought the vacation of the interim stay granted in M.P.No.2 of  5 2011. In M.P.No.5 of 2011, the AICTE sought the vacation of the ex parte  interim directions granted in M.P.No.3 of 2011.  8. M.P.Nos.2 to 5 of 2011 (petition for interim stay, petition for interim  directions, petition for vacating the interim stay and petition for vacating the  interim directions) came up for hearing before Elipe Dharma Rao, J., on  30- 8-2011. The learned Judge passed an order to the effect that \"any admission  made will be subject to the result of the writ petition\". 9. Again the miscellaneous petitions came up before the learned Judge  on 30.9.2011 and the learned Judge passed an order whose operative portion  in paragraphs 3 to 5 reads as follows:- \"3. Today, when the Miscellaneous Petitions for vacating  the interim orders  came up for  consideration,  learned Standing   Counsel for AICTE submitted that on the basis of the Resolution   dated 30.6.2011, notified on 4.7.2011, as per the 69th Meeting held   on 28.6.2011 by the Executive Committee and the 21st  Meeting  held  on  30.6.2011  by  the  Council,  the  eligibility  for  the  under   graduate programmes (full time) given under 1.1 of Appendix I of   Approval Process Hand Book 2011-2012 was reduced as 45% at   qualifying  level  for  general  category  students  and  40%  for   reserved category students for admission for the year 2011-2012. 4. As the subject matter of the Writ Petition pertains to the   academic year 2010-2011 for which all admissions are over and  the students are attending classes, I consider it  appropriate that   the Notification is applicable to the next academic year. 5. Taking into consideration the subject event, namely, the   Notification dated 4.7.2011, the order of stay granted on 30.6.2011  is restricted to the academic year 2010-2011 and the stay granted   6 is  modified  to  the  extent  indicated  above.  The  Miscellaneous  Petitions are disposed of accordingly.\" 10.  As  seen  from  the  operative  portion  of  the  order  passed  on  30.9.2011 in the miscellaneous petitions M.P.Nos.2 to 5 of 2011, the AICTE  itself  has  reduced  the  eligibility  criteria,  from  50%  to  45%  for  General  Category students and from 45% to 40% for Reserved Category students.  This reduction in the eligibility criteria was made at the 69th meeting of the  Executive Committee of the AICTE held on 28.6.2011 and confirmed at the  21st  meeting of  the Council  held on 30.6.2011.  But the reduction of  the  eligibility  criteria  was  notified  only  on  4.7.2011  to  take  effect  for  the  academic  year  2011-12.  This  happened after  the  above writ  petition was  admitted.  11. As a matter of fact, the State Government filed the above writ  petition challenging the eligibility criteria fixed as 50% for general category  candidates  and  45%  for  reserved  category  candidates  in  the  impugned  Regulations. But, within four days of the writ petition getting admitted, there  has been a downward revision of the eligibility criteria from 50% to 45% for  General Category candidates and from 45% to 40% for Reserved Category  candidates.  This  downward  revision  actually  benefited  the  Backward  communities and the General category candidates, though it also affected the  Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, as seen from G.O.Ms.No.151, Higher  Education dated 14.6.2010. 12.In the present writ petition, the Government assailed the eligibility  7 criteria fixed by AICTE and wanted to follow the eligibility criteria fixed under  G.O.Ms.No.151, Higher Education dated 14.6.2010. The eligibility criteria so  fixed under the Government Order for the academic year 2010-11 was as  follows: General Category candidates - 50% Backward communities - 45% MBC/DC - 40% SC/STs - 35% But, the norms fixed by the AICTE under the impugned Regulations was 50%  for  General  Category  candidates  and 45% for  Reserved  Categories.",

I have heard Mr.P.Vasanthakumar Visveswaran, learned counsel for the  petitioner, Mr.M.C.Swamy, learned Special Government Pleader for respondents 1 and  2 and Mr.N.R.Chandran, learned Senior Counsel for the third respondent. 3. The facts, on which there are no disputes, are as follows:- (i) The third respondent herein presented for registration before the District  Registrar (second respondent), a document titled as a Sale Deed, stated to have been  executed  by  the  petitioner  on  21.6.2010,  conveying  a  house,  land  and  premises  bearing  old  Plot  No.29-A,  new  Door  No.11,  Venugopal  Avenue,  Spur  Tank  Road,  Chetpet, Chennai-31. (ii) Since the petitioner who was alleged to have executed the Sale Deed,  did not appear before the second respondent, the third respondent appears to have  filed an application for compulsory registration of the document. Therefore, the second  respondent issued a notice dated 6.9.2010, calling upon the petitioner to appear in  person  on  27.9.2010.  The  petitioner  appeared  before  the  second  respondent  and  disputed the claim of the third respondent that the petitioner executed the Sale Deed.  He also filed an interim reply at that time. (iii) Thereafter, the second respondent passed an order dated 21.10.2010,  holding that in view of the denial of execution by the petitioner, the third respondent  should proceed with further action. (iv)  Thereafter,  the  third  respondent  filed  an  appeal  purportedly  under  3 Section  73  of  the  Registration  Act,  1908,  as  against  the  order  dated  21.10.2010  passed by the second respondent under Section 36 of the Act. Taking up the same on  file, the second respondent issued notices to both parties, calling upon them to appear  for an enquiry. (v) The petitioner submitted preliminary objections to the notice issued by  the second respondent on the ground that an appeal to the second respondent as  against his own order is not maintainable. However, the said preliminary objection was  overruled by the second respondent by an order dated 23.11.2010. (vi) Thereafter, the petitioner filed a reply to the appeal filed by the third  respondent, on 25.11.2010. (vii) The second respondent then held an enquiry, permitted both parties to  lead  oral  and documentary  evidence,  heard  arguments  and passed  the  impugned  order dated 7.4.2011, directing the compulsory registration of the Sale Deed. As a  matter  of  fact,  3  persons  were  examined  as  witnesses  on  the  side  of  the  third  respondent and two documents were marked in evidence on their side. On the side of  the petitioner one document was filed and the petitioner examined himself as the sole  witness on his side. On the basis of the oral and documentary evidence, the second  respondent  passed  an  order,  directing  compulsory  registration.  Aggrieved  by  the  same, the petitioner is before this Court. 4. The petitioner assails the impugned order on the following grounds:- (i) that when once the petitioner denied execution of the Deed in question,  it was not open to the second respondent direct the compulsory registration of the  document, after adjudicating upon the question whether the petitioner executed the  document or not; (ii)  that  the  second  respondent  virtually  decided  both  the  original  4 proceedings under Section 36 and the appeal under Section 73, thereby violating the  fundamental principles that prohibit the same person who passed the original order  from deciding the appeal arising out of his own order; (iii) that when admittedly, the statement in the form of Annexure-1-A in  terms of  Rule  3(1-A)  of  the  Tamil  Nadu Stamp (Prevention  of  Under-valuation of  Instruments) Rules 1968, was  not enclosed to the Sale Deed, the District Registrar  was obliged to refuse to register the document; and (iv) that in any case, the findings arrived at by the District Registrar in the  impugned order are totally perverse. GROUND No.1: 5. The primary contention of the petitioner is that he did not execute the  Sale Deed. His case is that he had business transactions with the third respondent;  that the third respondent owed more than a sum of Rs.2.5 crores to the petitioner;  that  in  the  course  of  business  transactions,  the  third  respondent  obtained  his  signatures in blank papers, for the purpose of some statutory compliances and that  those papers could have been made use of by the third respondent to prepare a Sale  Deed. Therefore, the core contention of the petitioner is that he never executed the  Sale Deed in question. 6.  However,  the  petitioner  admits  that  the  signatures  contained  in  the  document  presented  for  compulsory  registration,  are  his  own signatures.  In  other  words, the petitioner categorically admits the signatures found in the document to be  his own, though he denies having executed the Sale Deed. Therefore, the question  that arises first for consideration is as to whether a person whose signatures are found  in a Deed of Conveyance could be said to have \"executed\" the Deed of Conveyance or  not. 5 7.  Unfortunately,  the  expression  \"executed\"  is  not  defined  in  the  Registration Act, 1908. But, it is defined in Section 2(12) of the Indian Stamp Act,  1899. The definition is as follows:- \"(12)  Executed  and  execution.--\"executed\"  and \"execution\" used with reference to instruments, mean  \"signed\" and \"signature\". \" 8. The expression \"signed\" though not defined in the Registration Act, 1908  or in the Stamp Act, 1899, is defined in Section 3(56) of the General Clauses Act,  1897 to include even a \"mark\", if the person with reference to whom the expression is  used is unable to write his name. In other words, affixing a mark is treated akin to  signing a document. Signing as per Section 2(12) of the Stamp Act, is treated as  execution. 9. The expression \"execution\", is derived from the Latin word \"ex sequi\". It  means \"to follow out\" or \"follow to the end\" or \"perform\". Therefore, in a broader  sense, the expression \"execution\" would mean carrying out some act or course of  conduct, to its completion. But the Stamp Act has restricted the meaning of the word  to a mere sign or signature, perhaps on account of the fact that a broader meaning  would  virtually  convert  the  Registrar  into  a  Civil  Court,  conferring  powers  of  adjudication. 10. Since the word \"executed\" is not defined in the Registration Act, the  said  expression  should  be  assigned  the  same  meaning  that  is  given  to  it  in  the  complimentary enactment viz., the Stamp Act. It is needless to point out that the  Stamp Act and the Registration Act, are complimentary enactments, dealing with the  procedure to be followed for execution and registration of documents. Therefore, I  cannot  give to  the  word  \"executed\"  appearing in  the  Registration  Act,  1908,  any  meaning other than the one assigned it in the Indian Stamp Act, 1899. 6 11. Keeping the above basic principle in mind, if we look at the facts of this  case, the petitioner admits that the signatures contained in the document in question  are  his  signatures.  Therefore,  for  the  limited  purpose  of  an  enquiry  under  the  Registration  Act,  1908,  the  petitioner  should  be  deemed  to  have  executed  the  document. For all other purposes such as (i) deciding the question as to whether there  was  a  proper  conveyance  of  the  property  (ii)  deciding  the  question  whether  the  signatures were made on blank stamp papers (iii) deciding the question whether blank  but signed stamp papers were made use of by the third respondent to type out a Sale  Deed (iv) deciding the question whether title in the property had passed on and (v)  deciding the question whether the third respondent committed an act of fraud and  breach of trust, a mere signature in a document may not be sufficient.",

Petitioners  :    For Mr.T.V.Krishnamachari For Respondents       Mr.T.R.Rajagopalan, S.C. in both  :    For Mr.T.R.Rajaraman ----- COMMON JUDGMENT The  First  Appeal  A.S.No.589  of  1994  is  filed  by  defendants  2  to  5  challenging a judgment and decree passed on 5.4.1994 in O.S.No.110 of 1991 on  the  file  of  the  Principal  Sub  Court,  Coimbatore,  in  favour  of  the  plaintiffs,  (i)  declaring that the plaintiffs are the absolute owners of the suit schedule properties  (ii)  cancelling  the  Settlement  Deed  and  the  Trust  Deed  dated  25.2.1970  (iii)  directing recovery of possession of the properties to the plaintiffs (iv) directing the  defendants to render accounts and (v) ordering an inquiry into mesne profits. After  the decree, the plaintiffs filed an application in I.A.No.1338 of 1995 on the file of  3 the Trial Court,  praying for determination of the mesne profits.  The Trial Court  determined the mesne profits payable as Rs.10,77,772/- for the period from 1974  to 1996. In pursuance of the said order passed on 15.3.1996 in I.A.No.1338 of  1995,  the  plaintiffs  filed  an  Execution  Petition  in  E.P.No.97  of  2000.  In  the  Execution Petition, the objections of the judgment-debtors were overruled and an  order of attachment was passed on 26.10.2000. Therefore, challenging the said  order  of  attachment  passed  in  the  Execution  Petition,  the  defendants  2  to  5  (judgment-debtors) have also filed a revision petition in CRP No.3542 of 2000.  2. In  the first  appeal,  the appellants have taken out  2 miscellaneous  petitions C.M.P.Nos.10569 of  1996 and 17037 of  2000. While the former is  for  correcting the date of filing of the suit from 18-1-1974 to 28-1-1991 in the decree,  the latter is under Order 41, Rule 27, CPC, for reception of additional evidence.  Therefore,  the  First  Appeal,  the  miscellaneous  petitions  and  the  Civil  Revision  Petition arising out of the order of attachment passed by the Executing Court, were  all taken together for disposal. 3.  I  have  heard  Mr.T.V.Ramanujun,  learned  Senior  Counsel  for  the  appellants and Mr.T.R.Rajagopalan, learned Senior Counsel for the respondents. 4.  The  suit  O.S.No.110 of  1991,  out  of  which  the  above first  appeal  arises,  was  filed  by  one  Sengammal  and  her  son  N.Srinivasan,  against  one  N.Arivudai Nambi  (step-brother  of  N.Srinivasan)  and his  wife  and children.  The  prayer  in  the  suit  was for  (i)  a  declaration that  the  plaintiffs  are  the  absolute  owners  of  suit  'A'  schedule  properties  (ii)  cancellation  of  a  Trust  Deed  dated  25.2.1970 and a Settlement Deed dated 25.2.1970 (iii) delivery of possession of  plaint 'A' schedule properties and (iv) rendition of accounts for the income derived  from the properties from 1956 till the date of delivery of possession.  5. The second plaintiff N.Srinivasan died after the institution of the suit  4 and his wife and two children were brought on record as plaintiffs 3 to 5, by order  dated 7.2.1992. The first defendant also died after the institution of the suit, but his  wife and children were already parties to the suit.  6. The averments contained in the plaint in O.S.No.110 of 1991, in brief,  are as follows:- (i) One Mr.T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer was a Banker and Agriculturist at  Mettupalayam. He had 2 acres of wet land in Thiruvaiyar as ancestral property. He  acquired considerable properties in and around Mettupalayam. (ii) The said T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer had a wife by name Meenakshi.  Through his first wife, he had a son by name N.Arivudai Nambi. He was the first  defendant in O.S.No.110 of 1991. When he was a child, his mother (first wife of  T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer)  died. Therefore T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer married one  Smt.Sengammal, who was the first plaintiff in the suit (first respondent herein).  Through her, T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer had a son by name N.Srinivasan, who was  the second plaintiff in the suit. The plaintiffs 3, 4 and 5 were the wife and minor  children of the second plaintiff N.Srinivasan. (iii) T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer died on 25.1.1945, within 2 years of the  birth of the second plaintiff N.Srinivasan, on 25.1.1943. At the time of his death,  the first defendant was aged 12 years. Therefore,  the properties left behind by  Narayanaswamy Iyer, came under the management of the first plaintiff, who was  assisted by one A.R. Krishnamurthy Iyer. (iv) On 23.8.1954, a partition was effected by a registered instrument.  But the properties continued under common management. At that time, the first  defendant was a major, studying in the Madras Law College. After completion of the  law degree, the first defendant took over the possession and management of the  properties  as  well  as  the  banking  business  of  the  family  in  1956.  The  second  5 plaintiff  was  still  a  minor  and  the  first  defendant  appointed  the  aforesaid  A.R.Krishnamurthy Iyer as his Manager. (v) The first defendant brought about another partition on 14.9.1959. But  still the management of the properties, assets and the family business continued to  be with the first defendant. Even the properties set apart for the second plaintiff,  under the said Partition Deed, continued under the control and management of the  first defendant. He cultivated the lands, received the income, paid the taxes and  dealt with the investments and assets. He had all the documents under his custody  and control. (vi) The second plaintiff completed M.B.B.S. in 1966 and M.S. thereafter  and he decided to leave for U.S.A. for higher studies. At that time in 1970, a bill to  amend the Madras Land Reforms Act, was introduced to reduce the ceiling limit on  the holding of agricultural lands. Therefore, the first defendant represented to the  plaintiffs that certain documents were required to be executed for the purpose of  keeping the lands out of the reach of the impending legislation.  (vii) Placing trust and confidence in him, the plaintiffs 1 and 2, who were  the step-mother and step-brother respectively of the first defendant, affixed their  signatures in 2 documents prepared by the first defendant. The contents of the  documents  were neither read over  nor explained to the plaintiffs.  The plaintiffs  were  assured  by  the  first  defendant  that  the  documents  were  only  sham and  nominal and not intended to be acted upon. They were indeed never acted upon.  (viii) No title was conveyed or passed on under those two documents,  one of which was a Trust Deed dated 25.2.1970 and the other a Settlement Deed.  The Trust Deed was executed on stamp papers of the value of Rs.3.75. But actually  no Trust by name T.K.Narayanaswamy Iyer Family Education Trust ever came into  existence. The Trust Deed and the Settlement Deed were sham and nominal and  6 were nothing but an attempt to grab the properties by exploiting the plaintiffs.  (ix) The Settlement Deed was prepared on two stamp papers of the value  of Rs.1.25 p. each, though it purported to convey properties worth Rs.44,000/- by  the first plaintiff in favour of the second defendant, who was none other than the  wife of the first defendant. (x) Both the documents were nothing but the outcome of a scheme of  fraud committed by the first defendant. These documents were brought about by  misrepresentation of facts, taking advantage of the impending land legislation.",

Petitioner  Vs 1.Union of India,    Represented by the Secretary,    Ministry of Law, Justice and Company Affairs,    New Delhi-110 001. 2.The Registrar-General,    High Court of Madras,    Chennai-600 104. 3.Justice Mr.M.Vijayaraghavan,    Judge, High Court of Madras,    Chennai-600 104. ..  Respondents Writ Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, praying for the  issue of a Writ of Quo Warranto against the third respondent requiring him to show  the authority to hold the Office of Judge of the Madras High Court and consequently  declare that he is not entitled to continue to hold the said Office. For Petitioner :  Mr.K.Bharathi (Party-in-Person)  O R D E R (  ORDER OF THE COURT WAS MADE BY V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN, J. )   The petitioner, who is an Advocate practising in this Court and who is also the  State Convener of Democratic Advocates' Association, has come up with the above  writ petition, seeking the issue of a Writ of Quo Warranto, questioning the authority of  2 the third respondent to continue in Office. 2. Heard Mr.K.Bharathi, the petitioner-in-person. 3. The third respondent belonged to the Subordinate Judiciary of the State  of Tamil Nadu. His name was recommended for elevation to the Bench of this Court by  the Collegium of Judges of this Court. After the approval of the said recommendation,  by the Collegium of the Supreme Court, the third respondent was appointed as an  Additional Judge of this Court by a Warrant issued by the President of India in terms  of the Article 217 of the Constitution of India. He assumed Office on 26.3.2012. 4. The petitioner has not raised any objection to the appointment of the  third respondent as such. It is not the case of the petitioner that the third respondent  had suffered any disqualification at the time when his name was recommended for  appointment or at the time when the Warrant of Appointment was actually issued.  There  is  no  dispute  about  the  fact  that  the  third  respondent  is  also  qualified  for  appointment to the post of Additional Judge of this Court in terms of Clause (2) of  Article 217 of the Constitution of India. 5. It is also not the case of the petitioner that the process of appointment of  the third respondent was actually faulty. The petitioner does not contend that there  was no proper recommendation by the Collegium nor does he contend that certain  relevant considerations that should have weighed with the Collegium, were not taken  into account before recommending his name for appointment. 6.  Actually,  the  complaint  of  the  petitioner  is  that  an  advertisement  appeared in the Tamil Newspaper viz., 'Daily Thanthi'  in its  Madurai  Edition dated  21.11.2012. The advertisement carried a group photograph purportedly taken on the  occasion of the wedding reception of  the third respondent's  son. Seen in the said  photograph were, the third respondent, and his wife, apart from the Chief Minister of  3 Tamil Nadu, the newly married couple and the parents of the bride. The advertisement  contained at the bottom, a message of thanks to the Chief Minister for having blessed  the couple. At the bottom of of the advertisement, the names of the third respondent,  his wife and the names of the parents of the bride are also printed. The message of  thanks carries certain adulations to the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu. 7. On the basis of the said advertisement, it is contended by Mr.K.Bharathi,  the petitioner, appearing in person, that the third respondent would not henceforth be  able  to  discharge  his  functions  as  a  Judge  of  this  Court  in  an  unbiased  manner.  According to the petitioner, the Office of Judgeship of the High Court carries with it,  onerous duties and responsibilities and that they could be effectively discharged only  by persons of tried integrity, impeccable character and sterling qualities. Therefore,  the petitioner contends that once a person appointed to the post, identifies himself as  a person belonging to a political party by issuing such advertisements, it would tarnish  the image of the judiciary and make people lose faith that they repose in the judiciary. 8. The above contention of the petitioner is based only upon presumptions  and  surmises.  The  entire  writ  petition  proceeds  on  the  presumption  that  the  advertisement in question had actually been issued by the third respondent. But, we  have no proof before us to show that the advertisement was actually issued either by  the third respondent or at his behest. When confronted on this, Mr.K.Bharathi, the  petitioner contended that it is for the third respondent to come up with a denial. But,  we do not think so. At the outset, it is the bounden duty of the petitioner to produce  some materials of probative value to show that the advertisement was either issued  by or at the behest  of the third respondent.  It  is  only after  some material  worth  consideration is produced, that we can call upon the third respondent to admit or deny  the same. 4 9. It is needless to point out that advertisements, especially of this nature,  could be issued by any person.  Just  as wedding invitations printed in Tamil Nadu  contain  the  names  of  several  friends  and  relatives  as  hosts,  these  types  of  advertisements also normally carry the names of several  persons,  with or without  their concurrence. Unless the advertisement had been issued by or at least with the  tacit approval of the person concerned, we cannot presume that the person involved,  actually subscribed to the same. 10. From the grievance projected by the petitioner in his affidavit and the  contentions raised before us, it is clear that the objection of the petitioner is not to the  very appointment of the third respondent, but to his continuance in Office after the  issue of the advertisement. If an objection is made to the continuance in Office of a  person,  who  is  a  Judge  of  any  High  Court,  the  same  could  be  done  only  in  impeachment proceedings. 11. While it is open to the High Courts and the Supreme Court to entertain a  Writ of Quo Warranto challenging an appointment, it may not be possible for the High  Court to question the continuance in Office of a person, on the ground that he had  actually misconducted himself.  The law on this  aspect is very clear.  Under limited  circumstances, as was done by this Court and confirmed by the Supreme Court in  N.KANNADASAN vs. AJAY KHOSE AND OTHERS reported in (2009) 7 SCC 1,  it  would be open to this Court to see if the procedure prescribed by law was followed in  the  matter  of  appointment  of  a  person.  But  any  act  of  omission  or  commission  attributed to a person after his appointment to the Office, cannot be made the subject  matter of a Writ of Quo Warranto. 12.  Though the writ  petitioner,  despite being an Advocate,  has failed to  make even a remote reference to the principles of judicial conduct that bind Judges  5 morally, his writ petition is essentially directed towards the same. But the resolution of  the  conflict  between  the  principle  of  accountability  and  the  principle  of  judicial  independence, has been receiving the attention of Jurists and concerned citizens the  world over for several decades. While a statutorily enforceable frame work could not  so  far  emerge  (with  the  exception  of  the  recent  Bill  that  is  pending  before  the  Parliament),  Groups of  Judges of various countries have evolved Codes of  Judicial  Conduct at the National level right from 1972. Some of them are:- (i) The Code of Judicial Conduct adopted by the House of Delegates of the  American Bar Association in August 1972. (ii) Declaration of Principles of Judicial Independence issued by the Chief  Justices of the Australian States and Territories. (iii) Code of Conduct for the Judges of the Supreme Court of Bangladesh  prescribed by the Supreme Judicial Council. (iv) Ethical Principles for Judges drafted at the Canadian Judges Conference  and endorsed by Canadian Judicial Council in 1998. 13. Taking clue from the above, the Conference of Chief Justices of India  convened in 1999, adopted what is known as \"Re-statement of Values of Judicial Life\".  Immediately following the adoption of the same, a Meeting of the Judicial Group on  Strengthening Judicial Integrity, which later came to be known as Judicial Integrity  Group, was held at the United Nations Office in Vienna in April 2010. The Group took  two decisions at this Meeting. The first was the Strengthening of Judicial Integrity by  effecting  systematic  reforms.  The  second  was  the  preparation  of  universally  acceptable statement of judicial standards. The work of preparation was entrusted to  the Co-ordinator. After the Co-ordinator submitted a report, a second Meeting of the  Judicial Integrity Group was held in Bangalore in February 2001.",

Advocate General     assisted by     Mr.V.Subbiah, Spl. Govt. Pleader &     Mr.D.Vairamuthu, Govt. Advocate for R5 ----- O R D E R (Made by V.RAMASUBRAMANIAN,J.) The petitioner,  who is  a practising Advocate and who claims to be  carrying on social activities for the welfare of the public at large, has come up  with  the  above  writ  petition  seeking  issue  of  a  writ  of  Quo  Warranto  questioning the authority of the sixth respondent to hold the office of the  Director General of Police in Tamil Nadu. 2. We have heard Mr.G.Ethirajulu, learned counsel for the petitioner  and  Mr.A.Navaneethakrishnan,  Advocate  General  and  Mr.P.H.Aravindh  Pandian, learned Additional Advocate General for the State. 3. Before getting into the controversy raised in this writ petition, it is  necessary to take note of certain facts, against the backdrop of which, the  issues raised herein may have to be considered. Therefore, they are recorded  as follows: 3 (a) After 30 years of India attaining independence and after about 116  years of the existence of an archaic law, in the form of the Indian Police Act,  1861, the Government of India constituted a National Police Commission in  November 1977, for the purpose of examining the role and performance of  the Police both as a law enforcing agency and as an institution to protect the  rights of citizens under the Constitution.  (b)  Though  the  Commission  filed  several  reports  during  the  period  1979 to 1981, they were just consigned to the cold storage. Therefore, in the  year 1996, one Mr.Prakash Singh and another, both of whom belonged to the  Indian Police Service, along with an organisation known as Common Cause,  filed a public interest writ petition under Article 32 of the Constitution before  the Supreme Court in W.P.(Civil) No.310 of 1996 seeking various directions,  including a direction to the Government of India, to frame a new Police Act,  in order to ensure that the police force is made accountable primarily to the  law of the land and the people of the country.   (c) After 10 years, the writ petition saw the light of the day and on  22.9.2006, the Supreme Court passed an order, issuing various directions.  Two directions are relevant for deciding the case on hand. They are (i) that  all the State Governments shall constitute a State Security Commission as a  watchdog  body  on  the  models  suggested  by  the  NHRC  or  the  Rebeiro  Committee or the Sorabjee committee, to ensure that the State Police force  is insulated from unwarranted influence or pressure by the Government; and  (ii) that the Director General of Police of the State shall be selected by the  State  Government  from  amongst  the  three  senior-most  officers  of  the  department who have been empanelled for promotion to that rank by Union  Public Service Commission on the basis of their length of service, very good  4 record and range of experience for heading the police force. (d) Direction numbers 1 and 2 issued by the Supreme Court require to  be extracted, as some of the contentions raised in the writ petition revolve  around the same. Therefore, they are extracted as follows: State Security Commission (1)  The  State  Government  are  directed  to  constitute  a  State   Security  Commission  in  every  State  to  ensure  that  the  State   Government does not exercise unwarranted influence or pressure  on  the  State  police  and  for  laying  down  the  broad  policy   guidelines so that the State police always acts according to the   laws  of  the  land  and  the  Constitution  of  the  country.  This   watchdog body shall  be headed by the Chief  Minister or Home   Minister as Chairman and have the DGP of the State as its ex- officio Secretary. The other members of the Commission shall be  chosen in such a manner that it is able to function independent of   Government control. For this purpose, the State may choose any of   the  models  recommended  by  the  National  Human  Rights  Commission,  the Ribeiro Committee or the Sorabjee Committee,   which are as under: NHRC Ribeiro Committee Sorabjee Committee 1. Chief Minister/HM  as Chairman. 1. Minister i/c Police   as Chairman. 1. Minister i/c Police   (ex-officio   Chairperson). 2. Lok Ayukta or, in   his absence, a retired  Judge of High Court   to be nominated by  Chief Justice or a  Member of State   Human Rights   Commission. 2. Leader of   Opposition 3. Leader of   Opposition 3. A sitting or retired   Judge nominated by  Chief Justice of High  Court. 3. Judge, sitting or  retired, nominated by  Chief Justice of High  Court. 3. Chief Secretary 4. Chief Secretary 4. Chief Secretary 4. DGP (ex-officio   Secretary) 5. Leader of  5. Three non-political  5. Five independent   5 NHRC Ribeiro Committee Sorabjee Committee Opposition in Lower  House citizens of proven  merit and integrity. Members. 6. DG Police as  Secretary. 6. DGP as ex-officio   Secretary. The recommendations of this Commission shall be binding   on the State Government. The  functions  of  the  State  Security  Commission  would  include laying down the broad policies and giving directions for  the  performance  of  the  preventive  tasks  and  service  oriented   functions of the police, evaluation of the performance of the State   police and preparing a report thereon for being placed before the   State legislature. Selection and Minimum Tenure of DGP: (2) The Director General of Police of the State shall be selected by  the State Government from amongst the three senior-most officers   of  the Department  who have been empanelled for promotion to   that rank by the Union Public Service Commission on the basis of   their length of service, very good record and range of experience   for heading the police force. And, once he has been selected for   the job, he should have a minimum tenure of at least two years  irrespective  of  his  date  of  superannuation.  The  DGP  may,   however,  be  relieved  of  his  responsibilities  by  the  State  Government  acting  in  consultation  with  the  State  Security   Commission consequent upon any action taken against him under   the All India Services (Discipline and Appeal) Rules or following  his conviction in a court of law in a criminal offence or in a case  of corruption, or if he is otherwise incapacitated from discharging   his duties.\"   (e) Despite the fact that a period of six years has elapsed from the  date  of  issue  of  the  above  directions,  only  12  State  Governments  have  enacted a law to comply with the directions of the Supreme Court in letter  and spirit. The State of Tamil Nadu has not so far enacted any law. (f)  On  31-8-2008,  one  Mr.K.P.Jain,  was  appointed  as  the  Director  6 General of Police (Law and Order). This post is actually the Head of the Police  Force  in  Tamilnadu.  When  Mr.K.P.Jain  went  on  leave  from  18-1-2010,  preparatory to his retirement in April 2010, one Mrs.Letika Saran, an officer  belonging to the 1976 batch, was appointed by the State Government as the  Director General of Police. Challenging the appointment so made, a senior  officer by name R.Nataraj, belonging to the 1975 batch, filed an application  before the Central Administrative Tribunal, Chennai Bench in O.A.No.245 of  2010.",

Appellant Vs. K.Ramanujam, IPS Director General of Police (Law & Order) Government of Tamil Nadu Dr. Radhakrishnan Road Mylapore,  Chennai 600 004. ..

This  criminal  appeal  has  been  filed  against  an  order  passed  by  a  learned  Judge  of  this  Court  on  28.10.2011  in  an  application  filed  by  the  appellant herein under Section 195(1)(b) of the Code of Criminal Procedure,  read with Article 226 of the Constitution. By the said order impugned in this  2 appeal, the learned Judge rejected the prayer of the appellant to initiate an  enquiry into the offences allegedly committed by the sole respondent under  Section 188 of the Indian Penal Code. 2. We have heard Mr.T.Jaishankar, learned counsel for the appellant. 3. This case has had a chequered history, which is, at once, interesting  as well as agonising. The narration of all the historical facts, though painful,  is necessary, in order to highlight the manner in which there has been an  abuse of the process of court and the manner in which, the system is sought  to be ridiculed. Therefore, the history of this litigation is recorded as follows: (a) The appellant is a Burma repatriate. She and her husband own a  house at No.116/1, E.H. Road, Sharma Nagar, Vyasarpadi, Chennai 600 039.  Their next door neighbour, by name Alaguvel Nadar, started putting up a  construction in the first floor of his property. Since the  proposed construction  was likely to result in the window of the bedroom of the appellant's house  being shut and her easementary right to light and ventilation likely to be  infringed, the appellant and her husband protested; (b) According to the appellant, her next door neighbour was a powerful  person  in  the  locality,  who  wielded  lot  of  influence  with  the  police.  The  protest by the appellant, about the construction put up by her neighbour,  appears to have led to a scuffle on 26.9.2004; (c) In the scuffle, the appellant is stated to have suffered some injuries  leading to the registration of a complaint in Crime No.741 of 2004 against the  neighbour of the appellant. But a counter complaint in Crime No.766 of 2004  3 was lodged against the appellant, her husband and all the members of her  family, at the instance of the neighbour; (d) In the FIR in Crime No.741 of 2004, a closure report was sought to  be filed by the police, as though there was a mistake of fact. Upon receiving  notice of the filing of the closure report, the appellant filed a protest petition  before  the  V  Metropolitan  Magistrate,  Chennai.  Consequently,  the  closure  report was rejected by the learned Magistrate and further investigation was  also ordered; (e)  However,  further  investigation  was  not  carried  out,  forcing  the  appellant  to  file Crl.O.P.No.8405 of  2005 on the file  of  this  Court  for the  transfer of investigation; (f) In the meantime, the appellant also lodged a complaint against the  erring  police  officials,  with  the  Commissioner  of  Police  on  04.5.2006  and  followed it up with a petition in Crl.O.P.No.18492 of 2006. The said petition  was disposed of on 16.6.2007, after taking on record, an Action Taken Report  filed by the Assistant Commissioner, with a direction to the prosecution to  move a  petition  before  the  trial  Court  under  Section 319 of  the  Code of  Criminal Procedure, in the pending criminal case C.C.No.5972 of 2006; (g) However, the appellant again filed a petition in Crl.O.P.No.11684 of  2007 seeking alteration of charges, for the inclusion of the offences under  Sections  354  and  509,  IPC.  The  same  was  disposed  of  on  24.4.2007,  directing the Public Prosecutor to take action under Section 216 of the Code; (h)  Thereafter,  the  trial  in  the  criminal  case  commenced  and  the  4 appellant, who was the de facto complainant, had a tiff with the Assistant  Public Prosecutor handling the case. A complaint was lodged by the appellant  against the Assistant Public Prosecutor, who was also a lady. The appellant  also filed Crl.O.P.No.4167 of 2008 on the file of this Court for a direction to  appoint a different Public Prosecutor. When the said petition came up, the  Assistant Public Prosecutor recused herself and the Director of Prosecutions  appointed another Assistant Public Prosecutor; (i) When the trial in the criminal case C.C.No.5972 of 2006 continued,  the  appellant  filed  the  next  petition  in  Crl.O.P.No.22571  of  2007  for  a  direction to the prosecution to take steps to mark the oral evidence of eight  eye witnesses recorded at the time of hearing of the protest petition against  the original closure report. The said petition was disposed of by this Court  with a direction to the trial Court to complete the trial within six months; (j) However, the police officers who received summons in C.C.No.5972  of 2006, after  further investigation, came up before this Court by way of  Crl.O.P.No.2652 of 2009 challenging the summons issued by the trial Court.  A learned Judge ordered notice in the said  Crl.O.P.No.2652 of 2009 and also  granted an interim stay of  further proceedings in the trial of  the criminal  case. Upon coming to know of the same, the appellant filed an application  and got herself impleaded in Crl.O.P.No.2652 of 2009. She also filed a vacate  stay  petition.  But,  it  appears  that  the  vacate  stay  petition  neither  got  numbered, nor returned, for about six months. However, another petition in  Crl.M.P.No.4 of 2009 filed by the appellant for taking action against the police  5 officers for committing perjury got numbered. But, it did not get listed for a  long time; (k)  Eventually,  the  miscellaneous  petitions  were  posted  for  hearing  before one learned Judge. But,  the counsel for the appellant filed  a memo  requesting the miscellaneous petitions to be posted before the same Judge  who had earlier granted interim stay of further proceedings in Crl.M.P.No.1 of  2009 in Crl.O.P.No.2652 of 2009. This was on the ground that a perjury had  been committed before the learned Judge who granted stay of the trial, by  not  bringing  to  his  notice,  an  earlier  order.  Therefore,  the  miscellaneous  petitions were posted before the same learned Judge who first passed orders  of stay in the main petition; (l)  But,  for  reasons  which we could  not  decipher,  the  said  learned  Judge recused himself, resulting in the matter being posted before another  Judge; (m)  Objecting to  the  posting  of  the  matter  before  another  learned  Judge,  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  filed  a  memo  in  USR  No.321/2010  requesting the Court to post all those miscellaneous petitions in Crl.O.P.No.  2652 of 2009 before a Division Bench, in order to decide the question as to  whether a perjury petition can be heard by another Judge or not. The request  was  conceded  and it  was  posted  before  a  Division  Bench.  But,  after  the  Division Bench started hearing the case, the roster changed and it came to  be listed before yet another Division Bench. Subsequently, the petitions were  posted before one of the two Judges constituting the Division Bench, on the  6 ground that it was a matter to be heard by a single Judge; (n)  When  the  learned  single  Judge  was  about  to  pass  orders  in  Crl.O.P.No.2652 of 2009, the counsel for the appellant filed a memo dated  -.9.2010, objecting to the disposal by the said learned Judge. Therefore, that  learned Judge recused himself, leading to the petition being posted before  yet another learned Judge; (o) While the long list of criminal petitions narrated above were getting  tossed  from  Bench  to  Bench,  the  appellant  gave  a  representation  dated  15.7.2010 to the Registrar General of this Court, alleging that the officials of  the Registry of this court were responsible for dilatory tactics in not posting  the petitions filed by her, then and there. The representation was followed by  a writ  petition in W.P.No.21339 of  2010,  seeking a writ  of  Mandamus to  direct the Registrar General to order an enquiry into the allegations against  the officials of the Registry; (p) In the said writ petition W.P.No.21339 of 2010, the then Registrar  General  Smt.S.Vimala,  filed  a  counter  affidavit  to  the  effect  that  on  the  complaint of the appellant, a report was already called for from the Assistant  Registrar (Criminal) and that based upon his report  dated 15.9.2010, the  complaint against the officials of the Registry was closed on 22.9.2010, as  baseless; (q)  Taking  exception  to  the  counter  so  filed  by the  then  Registrar  General,  the  appellant  filed  a  petition  in  M.P.SR.No.25417  of  2011  in  W.P.No.21339  of  2010,  seeking  action  against  the  Registrar  General  for  7 perjury. This petition was posted before Court for maintainability and it was  later numbered as M.P.No.1 of 2011.",

By the  impugned judgment,  the High Court\naffirmed the death sentence passed by the learned Additional\nSessions  Judge,  Banswara,  in  Sessions  Case  No.  122/93\nagainst the  appellant in D.B. Criminal Murder Reference No.\n3/94 and  dismissed D.B.  Criminal (Jail). Appeal No. 602/94\npreferred by the appellant before the High Court against the\nconviction under  Section 302  I.P.C. and  sentence of death\nawarded against him by the learned Additional Sessions Judge\nin the said Sessions Case No. 122/93.\n     The appellant  sent a  special leave  petition from the\nJail where he is lodged. Initially a learned counsel of this\nCourt was  appointed as  Amicus Curiae to represent the case\nof the  appellant. Later on, the appellant wrote a letter to\nthe Registry of this Court expressing his intention that one\nof the three advocates mentioned by him in his letter may be\nengaged to represent his case before this Court. Pursuant to\nsuch request, Mr. Natarajan, a senior advocate of this Court\nagreed to appear as amicus curiae in deference to the desire\nof the  appellant. We appreciate such gesture on the part of\nMr. Natarajan,  for accepting  the case  of the appellant as\namicus curiae.\n     The appellant  was committed  to a  Sessions  Trial  in\nSessions Case  No.  122/93  before  the  learned  Additional\nSessions Judge, Banswara, on the charge of committing murder\nof five  persons including  the wife and three minor sons of\nthe appellant  and attempting  to murder  his own mother and\nthe wife  of a  neighbour. The  trial court after relying on\nthe evidences  of witnesses  including injured eye-witnesses\ninter alia  came to  the finding  that the  prosecution  had\nestablished by  leading cogent  evidence that  the appellant\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 11 \nwas guilty  of murdering five persons and he was also guilty\nfor attempting to murder his mother Smt. Mangi (PW 12) and a\nneighbour’s wife  Smt. Galal  (PW 4).  Considering the  fact\nthat the  commission of  the said murders was committed in a\nbrutal and barbaric manner, the trial court after convicting\nthe appellant  under Sections 302 IPC sentenced him to death\npenalty.  Such   sentence  of  death  was  referred  to  the\nRajasthan High  Court for  confirmation. The  reference  for\nconfirmation of death sentence was numbered as D.B. Criminal\nMurder Reference  No.3/94. The  appellant also  preferred an\nappeal against his conviction and sentence passed by learned\nAdditional Sessions  Judge in Sessions Case No. 122/93. Such\nappeal was  numbered as  D.B.  Criminal  (Jail)  Appeal  No.\n602/94. Both  the said  Murder Reference  No. 3/94  and Jail\nAppeal No.  602/94 were  disposed of  by the High Court by a\ncommon  judgment   dated  March  22,  1995,  dismissing  the\nCriminal Appeal No. 602/94 and confirming the death sentence\nby allowing Murder Reference No. 3/94.\n     Mr. Natarajan,  the learned senior counsel appearing as\namicus curiae  for the  appellant, has submitted that in the\ninstant case  there is  no  direct  evidence  regarding  the\nallegation of murdering four persons by the appellant namely\nhis wife  and three  minor children. Admittedly, besides the\nsaid dead  persons, only mother of the appellant was present\nin the  house at  the  time  of  murdering  wife  and  minor\nchildren of  the appellant.  The  mother  of  the  appellant\nherself was  injured  by  the  assailant  who  had  murdered\nappellant’s wife  and three  minor children.  But the mother\nwho was  examined as  PW 12  did not support the prosecution\ncase. She  has deposed that some unknown person murdered her\ndaughter-in-law and  three grand  children and  also injured\nher. She  was declared  hostile by  the prosecution.  Hence,\nthere is  no direct evidence that the appellant had murdered\nhis wife and three minor sons. The prosecution case has been\nsought to  be proved  by circumstantial evidence. But motive\nfor murdering  wife and  three minor sons is totally absent.\nIn  a   case  of  circumstantial  evidence,  motive  assumes\nconsiderable significance.  Mr. Natarajan has submitted that\neven if  this court  accepts the  concurrent finding  of the\ncourts below  that appellant is guilty of murdering his wife\nand three  minor  children  besides  murdering  another  man\nGulabji the  absence of motive requires to be considered for\nsustaining the  death penalty.  Mr. Natarajan  has submitted\nthat there  are eye-witnesses  to prove the prosecution case\nof murdering  Gulabji and  attempting to  murder Smt. Galal.\nThe wife  of Gulabji  before whose eyes Gulabji was murdered\nand Smt.  Galal  herself  has  deposed  in  support  of  the\nprosecution case.  The finding  by the Courts below that the\nappellant has  murdered Gulabji cannot be said to be without\nany basis  and he  fairly concedes that an attempt to assail\nsuch finding  may be  an exercise in futility. Mr. Natarajan\nhas, therefore,  submitted that in the facts of the case, it\nwill be  only appropriate  for him to confine his submission\non the  question  of  sentence  to  be  passed  against  the\nappellant.\n     Mr. Natarajan  has submitted that unfortunately in this\ncase, the  prosecution has failed to lead any evidence as to\nwhy the  appellant suddenly  killed  his  wife  who  was  in\nadvanced stage  of pregnancy  and three  minor children when\nhis wife  and his  three minor  children were  asleep in his\nhouse. Mr. Natarajan has also submitted that the prosecution\nhas also  failed to lead any evidence to indicate or even to\nsuggest as  to what was or could be the motive that impelled\nthe appellant immediately after murdering his wife and three\nminor children and injuring his own mother when she tried to\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 11 \nprevent him  from committing  such crime,  to  rush  to  his\nneighbour’s house  and to  attempt to  kill the  wife of the\nneighbour Smt. Galal (PW 4) who was admittedly then sleeping\nwith her daughter in their house. He has also submitted that\nunfortunately, there  is also  no evidence  from  which  any\nmotive can even remotely be inferred as to why the appellant\nthereafter killed  another neighbour,  an elderly  man  with\nwhom appellant  had no enmity, when the said old man Gulabji\nwas coming towards the house of Smt. Galal after hearing her\nshrieks on being injured by the appellant.\n     Mr. Natarajan  has submitted  that there is no evidence\nto  suggest  that  the  appellant  had  ever  suspected  the\nfidelity of  the wife  or any  extra marital relationship of\nhis wife  with anybody  or with  the neighbour,  namely  the\nhusband of  Smt. Galal. There is not even any whisper by the\nprosecution witnesses  that Smt.  Galal had  in  any  manner\ncaused annoyance  to the appellant and had ever attempted to\ndisturb the  conjugal life  of the  appellant so  that there\nmight be  an occasion  for the  appellant to  entertain some\nwrath or hatred against PW 4 Smt. Galal.\n     Mr. Natarajan has submitted that commission of crime is\nperpetrated for some reason which may be even ill founded or\nill-conceived. Sudden fit of passion, anger etc. actuated by\nvarious  considerations  like  hatred,  wrath,  a  sense  of\nrevenge etc. often induce an accused to commit murder.\n     Mr. Natarajan  has submitted  that motive  constituting\nmens rea  is a  very  relevant  factor  in  the  process  of\ndelicate balancing  between the  gravity of  the  crime  and\nconsequential sentence  to be  passed against  an accused on\nconsideration of mitigating factors.\n     Mr. Natarajan  has further  submitted that  there is no\nmaterial on  record to  justify a finding that the appellant\nwas insane  at the time of commission of crime and he failed\nto understand the implication of his misdeeds. The appellant\nhas also  not taken  any such  plea. Even  then, the  sudden\nimpluse, without  any plausible  motive to  kill his wife in\nadvanced stage  of pregnancy  and three  minor children with\nwhom love  was not  lost and  attempt to  kill innocent  old\nmother who  only tried to prevent the commission of crime of\nmurder of  his own  wife and children and above all taking a\nmad rush  to a  neighbour’s house and attempting to kill the\nneighbour’s wife while she was asleep and thereafter killing\nanother old neighbour Gulabji on the way, remains absolutely\ninexplicable. Such  wild behaviour of the appellant having a\nfair standard  of education  and upbringing  and exposure to\nteachers training,  only suggests  that he  was  temporarily\nseized of  a gigantic  psychic disorder.  Why and  how  this\nwretched transformation  had happened remains a mystery. The\ninvestigating  officer,  unfortunately,  did  not  make  any\nsincere effort  to  cause  enquiries  in  this  regard.",

The\nappellant  was declared elected, by a margin of  1873  votes\nover his nearest rival, the first respondent.\n    The  first respondent filed an election petition in  the\nHigh  Court claiming that the appellant’s election was  void\nand  that  he  should be declared elected in  place  of  the\nappellant. In support of his contention, he alleged  various\ncorrupt  practices  on the part of the appellant.  The  High\nCourt negatived all except two of the allegations, viz., (i)\nprinting  and publication on March 22, 1987, a day prior  to\nthe  election,  pamphlets containing a news  item  in  daily\n\"Malayala Manorama\" dated May 22, 1983, and (ii) publication\nof a wail poster, maligning the\n720\npersonal character and conduct of the first respondent.\n    The High Court held that both the said acts amounted  to\ncorrupt  practices within the meaning of Section  123(4)  of\nthe  Representation of People Act, 1951 and were  sufficient\nto void the election.\n    This  appeal  under  s. 116A of  the  Representation  of\nPeople Act, is against the High Court’s judgment.\nAllowing the appeal, this court,\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 35 \n    HELD: 1.1. As regards the pamphlets, the first  respond-\nent  in his election petition had relied upon  an  innuendo,\nand  the innuendo was based upon the fact that, firstly,  he\nwas  a  Marxist leader and, secondly, he  was  arrested  for\nharbouring the murderers. However, in the election petition,\nno  averment was made that it was because he was  a  Marxist\nleader  and was also arrested for harbouring  the  murderers\nthat  the  electorate was likely to construe  the  said  two\nstatements  as accusing him as the murderer. No  facts  were\npleaded  in  the Election Petition  whereby  the  electorate\nwould gather an impression that the first respondent was the\nmurderer of the said four victims. [733B-C; 746 E-F]\n    1.2.  Barring his own testimony, all other evidence  led\nby  the  first  respondent is also totally  silent  on  this\naspect  of  the  matter. None of his  witnesses  has  stated\nanywhere that the contents of the pamphlet had made out  the\nfirst respondent as the murderer of the four victims or even\nthat  they were capable of doing so. On the other hand,  all\nhis  witnesses  without exception are unanimous  that  after\nreading  the pamphlet the impression it created on them  was\nthat it referred to an incident which had taken place on the\nprevious  day  or to an earlier incident and  nothing  more.\nNone of the witnesses has stated that the said pamphlet even\nremotely  connected the first respondent with  the  murders.\nThe impression conveyed by the document that the Marxists or\nCommunists  were  murderers  and  therefore  the  electorate\nshould  not vote for them and hence it was  unfavourable  to\nthe  first respondent, was not an impression about his  per-\nsonal character/ conduct. It was an impression at best about\nhis political character/ conduct. In particular there was no\nimpression that he was the murderer or one of the murderers.\nAlthough the first respondent has also added at the end that\nmany persons who gathered such an impression, viz., that  he\nwas meant by the publication, had contacted him over  phone,\nhe  admitted that he did not examine anyone from  among  the\nsaid  persons.  This is a telling circumstance  against  him\nbecause he had\n721\nfollowed as a witness after all his witnesses were examined,\nand he knew that none of his witnesses had stated that  they\nhad  connected the imputations in the publication with  him.\nOn  the  other  hand, as stated earlier, not  only  all  his\nwitnesses  had stated that they had gathered the  impression\nthat  the incident had taken place the previous day  but  he\nhimself  was of the view that the publication was  meant  to\ncreate such impression and that it did so. Hence, there  was\nno  reason for the electorate to connect him with  the  said\nincident  even remotely. On his own testimony as well as  on\nthe testimony of his witnesses, therefore, it is clear  that\nthe publication was intended to create an impression and did\ncreate an impression that the incident of murders had  taken\nplace  a day previous to the election. If that is  so,  then\nthe  publication and the two allegedly offending  statements\nin  the same did not connect him with the murders much  less\nhad they called him a murderer. Even his arrest for harbour-\ning  the  accused  in the old incident of  murders  was  not\ncapable  of identifying him as the murderer in the  eyes  of\nthe  people.  None knew who were the accused  and  who  were\narrested in connection with the murders which were committed\nthe  previous day. The people, however, certainly knew  that\nthe first respondent was not arrested in connection with the\nsaid  murders.  Hence the extrinsic facts  which  the  first\nrespondent  stated in his testimony for the first time  even\nif they were given in the pleadings would not have spelt out\nthe  corrupt  practice. For those facts in the face  of  the\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 35 \nassertion of the first respondent himself were incapable  of\nidentifying him as the murderer in the eyes of the  elector-\nate.  For these reasons, the extrinsic facts given  for  the\nfirst  time  by the first respondent in his  testimony  were\nincapable of identifying him as the hand behind the  murders\nor  as  the  murderer in the eyes of  the  people.  [746F-H;\n751A-B; 755D-H; 756A-B]\n    1.3.  In the absence of the extrinsic  facts  supporting\nthe innuendo meaning of the publication, the petition lacked\nthe statement of material facts for spelling out the corrupt\npractice complained of. Either, therefore, the allegation of\nthe  corrupt  practice should have been struck  off  or  the\npetitioner  ought not to have been allowed to lead  evidence\nin support of it. [756C]\n    2.1.  Where the defamatory words complained of  are  not\ndefamatory  in the natural or ordinary meaning, or in  other\nwords,  they  are not defamatory per se but  are  defamatory\nbecause  of certain special or extrinsic facts which are  in\nthe  knowledge  of particular persons to whom they  are  ad-\ndressed, such innuendo meaning has to be pleaded and  proved\nspecifically by giving the particulars of the said extrinsic\nfacts.  It  is immaterial in such cases as  to  whether  the\naction is for\n722\ndefamation  or for corrupt practice in an  election  matter,\nfor  in  both cases it is the words complained  of  together\nwith  the  extrinsic  facts which constitute  the  cause  of\naction.  It  is true that Section 123(4) of the  Act  states\nthat  the statement of fact in question must be  \"reasonably\ncalculated  to prejudice the prospects\" of  the  complaining\ncandidate’s election. However, unless it is established that\nthe  words complained of were capable of being construed  as\nreferring to the personal character or conduct of the candi-\ndate  because  of some specific extrinsic facts  or  circum-\nstances which are pleaded and proved, it is not possible  to\nhold  that they were reasonably calculated to prejudice  his\nprospects  in  the  elections. For, in the  absence  of  the\nknowledge  of the special facts on the part of the  elector-\nate, the words complained of cannot be held to be reasonably\ncalculated to prejudice such prospects. Once, however, it is\nproved  by laying the foundation of facts that the words  in\nquestion  were,  by virtue of the knowledge of  the  special\nfacts, likely to be construed by the electorate as referring\nto  the  personal character or conduct  of  the  complaining\ncandidate, it may not further be necessary to prove that  in\nfact  the electorate had understood them to be so.",

Leave granted. \n2. Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a learned\nSingle  Judge  of  the  Punjab  and  Haryana   High  Court\ndismissing the appeal filed against the award dated 4.2.2003\npassed  by  Motor  Accidents  Claim  Tribunal,  Chandigarh  (in\nshort ‘Tribunal’). \n3. Background facts in a nutshell are as follows:\nIn an accident which took place on 16.11.1994 at about\n10.00  p.m.   K.C.  Aggarwal  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the\n‘deceased’)  who was sitting directly behind the driver lost his\nlife.  Balbir Singh (PW-1) was an eye witness to the accident.\nAt the relevant time, he was standing in front of Mayur Dhaba\nnear which the accident took place. He categorically deposed\nthat the jeep was coming from Bilaspur side and was going\ntowards  Sunder  Nagar  at  a  very  high  speed.  It  was  being\ndriven by the driver in the middle of the road. He also stated\nthat  a  truck  was  coming  from the  opposite  side  at  normal\nspeed. When the truck reached near the jeep, the driver of the\njeep applied brakes, but because the jeep was being driven at\n2\na very high speed, it came to halt in the middle of the road.\nThe back portion of the truck struck against  the right side\nportion of the jeep. Some persons rushed towards the jeep. In\nthe  meantime,  the  truck  sped  away  from  the  spot.  He\ncategorically stated that the accident occurred due to rash and\nnegligent driving of the jeep driver. The deceased left behind a\nwidow and three children. \nA claim petition was filed by the widow and the children\nunder Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1988 (in short\nthe  ‘Act’).  The  Tribunal  awarded  compensation  of\nRs.8,48,160/- along with interest @ 9% per annum from the\ndate of institution. \nAn appeal was filed before the High Court. It was pointed\nout  that  on the  death  of   K.C.  Aggarwal,  respondent  No.1-\nwidow had  been  provided  with  compassionate  appointment\nand she was getting salary of nearly  Rs.4,700/- p.m. (basic\npay of  nearly Rs.4,700/-)   and a residence  was provided to\n3\nher. The High Court did not accept this plea and observed that\nthe quantum of compensation has been rightly fixed.\n4. Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the\nbenefits which claimant has received on account of death of\nher  husband  have  to  be  deducted  while  computing  the\ncompensation, if  any, payable.  With reference to the factual\naspects  it  is  submitted  that  respondent  No.1  was  getting\nsalary of nearly Rs.4,700/- and therefore she was not entitled\nto  compassionate  appointment.  It  is  pointed  out  that  the\nappeal  filed  by  the  claimants  is  pending  adjudication  and\nwithout considering the relevant factors the High Court has\ndeclined to interfere.\n5. Learned counsel for the respondents on the other hand\nsubmitted that the judgment of the High Court is in order. \n6. There are several undisputed factors:  (i) the husband of\nrespondent No.1 had received fatal injuries in an accident; (ii)\nthe  claimants  seem to  be  facing  financial  problem;  (iii)  the\n4\nconcept of just compensation cannot be lost sight of. The High\nCourt does not appear to have considered the effect of amount\nreceived on account of compassionate appointment. \n7. In  United India Insurance Co. Ltd. and Ors. v.  Patricia\nJean Mahajan and Ors. (2002 (6) SCC 281) it was inter-alia\nobserved as follows:\n“24.  Mr.  Soli  J.  Sorabji  submitted  that  while\nassessing the amount of compensation, the benefits\nwhich have accrued to the claimants by reason of\ndeath must also be taken into account. A kind of\nbalancing  of  losses  and  the  gains  or  benefit  by\nreason of death would be necessary. In support of\nthe above contention he has referred to a decision\nreported in  Gobald Motors Service Limited v. R. M.\nK. Veluswami (1962 (1) SCR 929), and others. It is a\ndecision by a three-Judge Bench of this Court, and\nat  SCR  page  938  the  observations  made  by  the\nHouse  of  Lords  in  Davies  v.  Powell  Duffryn\nAssociated Collieries Ltd. (1942 AC page 601)  has\nbeen quoted which reads as follows : AIR ER p. 658\nB) \n\"The  general  rule  which  has  always\nprevailed in regard to the assessment of\ndamages under the Fatal Accidents Acts\nis  well  settled,  namely,  that any benefit\naccruing to a dependent by reason of the\nrelevant  death  must  be  taken  into\naccount. Under those Acts the balance of\nloss  and  gain  to  a  dependant  by  the\n5\ndeath must be ascertained,  the position\nof  each  dependant  being  considered\nseparately.\"\n25.  To  further  elaborate  the  above  proposition,\nobservations made by Lord Wright in Davies  case\n(supra) have also been quoted. It reads as follows :-\n\"The  damages  are  to  be  based  on  the\nreasonable  expectation  of  pecuniary\nbenefit  or  benefit  reducible  to  money\nvalue.  In  assessing  the  damages  all\ncircumstances which may be legitimately\nplaced  in  diminution  of  the  damages\nmust  be  considered…..The  actual\npecuniary, loss of each individual entitled\nto  sue  can  only  be  ascertained  by\nbalancing, on the one hand, the loss to\nhim of the future pecuniary benefit, and\non  the  other,  any  pecuniary  advantage\nwhich  from  whatever  source  comes  to\nhim by reason of the death.\"\nThe learned counsel laid stress on the last part of\nobservation  made  to  the  effect  that  -  for  the\npurposes  of  balancing  losses  and  gains  any\npecuniary  advantage  which  from whatever  source\ncome to them, has to be considered.\n26. It is submitted in Gobald's case the principle of\nDavies  Case  was  referred  and  taken  into\nconsideration. Reliance has also been placed on a\ndecision reported in  M/s. Sheikhupura Transport\nCo.  Ltd.  v.  Northern  India  Transport  Insurance\nCompany (1971 (1) SCC page 785), particularly to\nthe observations made by the Court in paragraph 6\nof the judgment where the principle in the case of\nGobald Motors (supra) has been reiterated. In this\nconnection  learned  counsel  for  the  Insurance\n6\nCompany  has  also  drawn  our  attention  to  the\ndecision in the case  of  Susamma Thomas (supra)\nparticularly on paragraph 8 of the report, where it is\nobserved that the principle in the case of Davies v.\nPowell  was adopted, in the case of Gobald Motors\n(supra).  It  is  thus  submitted  that  principle  of\nbalancing of loss and gains, so as to arrive at a just\nand  fair  amount  of  compensation  has  been\naccepted  by  this  Court  as  well.  On  behalf  of  the\nInsurance Company  Hodgson v. Trapp (1988 (3) All\nER 870) has been relied on in which our attention\nhas  particularly  been  drawn  to  the  following\nobservations made at All ER p. 873j-874b: \n\"……..the basic rule is that it is the net\nconsequential  loss  and  expense  which\nthe  Court  must  measure.  If,  in\nconsequence  of  the  injuries  sustained,\nthe plaintiff has enjoyed receipts to which\nhe  would  not  otherwise  have  been\nentitled, prima facie, those receipts are to\nbe  set  against  the  aggregate  of  the\nplaintiff's losses and expenses in arriving\nat the measure of his damages. All this is\nelementary and has been said over and\nover again. To this basic rule there are, of\ncourse,  certain  well  established,  though\nnot  always  precisely  defined  and\ndelineated,  exceptions.  But  the  Courts\nare,  I  think,  sometimes  in  danger,  in\nseeking  to  explore  the  rationale  of  the\nexceptions,  of  forgetting  that  they  are\nexceptions.  It  is  the  rule  which  is\nfundamental  and  axiomatic  and\nexceptions  to  it  which  are  only  to  be\nadmitted on grounds which clearly justify\ntheir treatment as such.\"\n7\nFrom  the  above  passage  it  is  clear  that  the\ndeductions  are  admissible  from  the  amount  of\ncompensation  in  case  the  claimant  receives  the\nbenefit  as  a  consequence  of  injuries  sustained,\nwhich otherwise he would not have been entitled to.\nIt does not cover cases where the payment received\nis  not  dependent  upon  an  injury  sustained  on\nmeeting with an accident. The other observation to\nwhich our attention has been drawn at page  876\nplacitum 'f' also does not help the contention raised\non behalf of the Insurance Company for deduction\nof  amounts  in  the  present  case.  The  Court  was\nconsidering  a  situation  where  due  to  the  injuries\nreceived  the  victim  was  claiming  cost  of  care\nnecessary  in  future  in  respect  of  which  statutory\nprovision, provided for attendant's allowance. It was\nfound that the statutory benefit  and the damages\nclaimed  were  designed  to  meet  the  identical\nexpenses.  This  is  however  not  so,  at  least  not\nshown, to be so in the case in hand.”\n8. Similarly,  in  Gobald  Motor  Service  Ltd.  and  Anr. Vs.\nR.M.K. Veluswami and Ors. (1962 (1) SCR 929 at p.938) it was\ninter-alia observed as follows:\n“The general rule which has always prevailed\nin regard to the assessment of damages under\nthe  Fatal  Accidents  Acts  is  well  settled,\nnamely,  that  any  benefit  accruing  to  a\ndependant  by  reason  of  the  relevant  death\nmust be taken into account.",

SINHA & MARKANDEY KATJU\nJUDGMENT:\nJ U D G M E N T\n[Arising out of SLP(C) No. 19222 of 2005]\nS.B. Sinha, J.\n        Leave granted.\n        Prakash Chandrakant Shreshti (hereinafter called ‘the deceased’) was \nworking as a Cleaner in Vehicle No. MH 09A 9727.  The said vehicle \nbelonged to Respondent No. 1.  He was travelling in the said vehicle in the \nnight of 27.9.2002.  He suddenly developed chest pain.  He was admitted to \nGovernment hospital, Mangaon where the doctor declared him dead.  \nIndisputably, the incident had occurred while deceased was performing his \nduties.\n        Appellant herein, the mother of deceased filed a Claim Petition under \nthe Workmen’s Compensation Act, 1923 (for short, ’the Act’) before the \nCommissioner for Workmen’s Compensation which was registered as \nWCA/SR/19/2003.  The vehicle being insured with the United India \nInsurance Company, it  was also impleaded as a party.  \nThe fact that at the time of his death, the deceased was discharging his \nduties is not disputed.  The autopsy was conducted wherein the cause of \ndeath was opined as Cardiac arrest due to Rupture Aortic Aneurysm.  No \ninjury on his body was found.  The only evidence which was brought on \nrecord was by way of  deposition of Appellant.  It was alleged :\n\"\\005My son died while working in the vehicle of R-1 and \ndue to the strain of work\\005\"\n        A copy of the Claim Petition has not been placed before us.  We, \ntherefore, are not sure as to whether there was any requisite pleading.   The \nfirst Respondent, however,  in his objection stated :      \n\"...It is further true that the said vehicle is used for \ncarrying the milk and on 27.9.2002 at about 9.15 hours, \nthe driver of the said vehicle Parasharam Chandrakant \nand the deceased\\026cleaner Prakash Chandrakant  came to \nthe Tavarewadi Chilling Centre for bringing the milk \nfrom Kolhapur, at that time, the deceased-Cleaner while \ngetting down from the said vehicle got pain in the chest \nand sat on the ground and immediately the driver of the \nsaid vehicle taken him to dispensary to Government \nHospital, Mangaon.  The Doctor of the said Hospital \nstated that deceased-Cleaner died due to Cardiac arrest.  \nIt is true that the said deceased died in the course of his \nemployment under this Respondent No. 1.\"\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 8 \n        The Insurer raised a plea of collusion between the employer and  \nAppellant in its written statement.   It, however,  need not be adverted to.  \nThe Commissioner for Workmen’s Compensation raised several \nissues.  The issue with which we are concerned is Issue No. 2, which is as \nunder :\n\"2.     Whether the accident occurred during the course of \nemployment and out of Employment?\"\n        The Workmen’s Compensation Commissioner did not analyze the \nevidence on record.  It did not arrive at a finding that the deceased met with \nan accident.  It proceeded on the basis that deceased being a workman, it \nwas obligatory on the part of  the first Respondent to maintain registers \nunder the provisions of the Minimum Wages Act.  \nThe Commissioner, however, dealt with the legal issue as regards \nmeaning of  ‘accidents and injury’, observing : \n\"15.    The more usual case of an accident is an event \nhappening externally to a man.  The less obvious cases of \naccident are strain causing rupture, bursting of aneurism, \nfailure of muscular action of the heart, exposure to \ndraught causing chill, exertion in a stokehold causing \napoplexy, shock causing neurasthenia etc.  Lord Atkin \ncalled them as \"Internal Accident\".  In such cases, it is \nhardly possible to distinguish in time between the \n‘accident’ and ‘injury’.  The rupture is an accident, at the \nsame time injury leading to death or incapacity at once or \nafter a lapse of time.  Thus in cases of internal accidents, \n\"Accidents\" and \"Injury\" coincide.\n16.     What the Act, therefore, really intends to convey is \nwhat might be expressed as an ‘accidental injury’.  But \nthe common factor in all cases of accident, whether \n‘internal’ or ‘external’ is some concrete happening at a \ndefinite point of time and incapacity resulting from \nhappening.\n17.     An accident happening to a person in or about any \npremises at which, he is for the time being employed for \nthe purpose of his employer’s trade or business shall be \ndeemed to arise out of and in the course of employment.\"\nLegal propositions are not in dispute.  What is in dispute is whether \nthe deceased died of an accidental injury in the course of  and out of \nemployment. \n   \n        An appeal was preferred thereagainst before the High Court by \nRespondent No. 3 under Section 30 of the  Act.  The said Appeal has been \nallowed by reason of the impugned judgment.  The High Court opined that \nthe findings of the Workmen’s Compensation were perverse and inconsistent \nwith the material on record as also bereft of any reason.  \n        It was held:-\n\"There is no material evidence to show that the \ndeceased workman was suffering from a heart ailment.  \nThere is also no evidence to demonstrate that the \nworkman was put through a sudden stressful condition in \nthe course of his duties, which brought on a cardiac \narrest.  In the face of these circumstances, the reasoning \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 8 \nof the Commissioner that the workman died as a result of \nan accident during and in the course of his employment, \nis difficult to be sustained.\"\n        Extensive reference was made by the High Court in its judgment to \nthe decisions of this Court in Regional Director, ESI Corporation and \nAnother v. Francis De Costa and Another [(1996) 6 SCC 1] and Saurashtra \nSalt Mfg. Co v. Bai Valu Raja Raja and Others  [AIR 1958  SC  881], to \nopine that the death of the workmen was not during the course of his \nemployment.     \n        Learned counsel appearing on behalf of Appellant would submit that \nthe High Court committed a manifest error in arriving at the said finding \ninsofar as it failed to take into consideration that by reason of the strain of \nwork, the cause of the death was accelerated.  As the Commissioner of the \nWorkmen’s Compensation Commission arrived at a finding of fact, it was \nurged, the same could not have been interfered with by the High Court in \nexercise of its jurisdiction under Section 30 of the Act  as no substantial \nquestion of law arose for its consideration.\n        Mr. Nandwani, however, supported the judgment of the High Court.  \nThe said Act was enacted to provide for  payment by certain classes of \nemployers to workmen for compensation against injury by accident.  The \nterm ‘accidental injury’ has not been defined under the Act.  The liability of \nthe employer for payment of compensation, however, would arise if a \npersonal injury is caused to a workman by accident arising out of and in the \ncourse of his employment.  What is necessary for attracting the charging \nprovision contained in Section 3 of the Act is that (i) an injury must be \ncaused to a workman; (ii) such injury must have been caused by an accident; \nand (iii) it arose out of or in the course of his employment.\n        Before we analyze the provisions of the Act, we may notice that in the \nComplaint Petition, there was no allegation that (i) the deceased met with his \ndeath by reason of any strain of work; and (ii) Appellant had no personal \nknowledge as regards quantum of or nature of  work required to be \nperformed by the deceased; and (iii)  as to how  service strain during his \nservices was caused.  \nThe deceased had admittedly suffered a massive heart attack.  Nothing \nhas been brought on record to show that the heart attack was caused while \ndoing any job.  Even according to employer, he at the relevant time was \nmerely getting down from the vehicle. \n        The driver of the vehicle who was brother of the deceased was the \nbest witness to state as to under what circumstances the deceased met with \nhis death or whether the death was occurred due to some strain.  He did not \nexamine himself.  The doctor who performed post mortem examination was \nalso not examined.  \nSufferance of heart disease amongst  young persons is not unknown .  \nA disease of heart may remain undetected.  A person may suffer mild heart \nattack but he may not feel any pain.  There must, thus,  be some evidence \nthat the employment contributed to the death of the deceased. It is required \nto be established that the death occurred during the course of employment.  \nThis Court in E.S.I. Corporation (supra) referred to with approval the \ndecision of Lord Wright in Dover Navigation Co. Ltd. v. Isabella Craig, \n[1940 AC 190], wherein it was held ",

PARAMESWARAN PILLAI & ANR.\n        Vs.\nRESPONDENT:\nUNION OF INDIA & ANR.\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:       12/04/2002\nBENCH:\nR.P. Sethi & D.M. Dharmadhikari\nJUDGMENT:\nSETHI,J.\n        Leave granted.\n        Denying them the benefit of the amendment to the Railways\nAccidents and Untoward Incidents (Compensation) rules, 1990 as amended\nin 1997 and relying upon its earlier judgment in Union of India v.\nThankaraj [1999 (3) KLT 320], the High Court refused to enhance the\ncompensation for the death of P. Suresh Kumar in a train accident which\nhad occurred on 17.7.1997.  Relying upon a judgment of this Court in\nRathi Menon v. Union of India [2001 (3) SCC 714] the appellants have\nprayed for setting aside the impugned judgment and for enhancement of\nthe compensation.\nThe facts giving rise to the filing of the present appeal are that\nwhile travelling from Thiruvalla to Jamnagar in Train No.6334 on a valid\nticket issued by the Southern Railways, the deceased was accidentally\nthrown out of the train on account of over-crowding near electric pillar\nat Km.134/4-5 between Chakarapalli and Penukonda Railway Stations.  As a\nresult of the fall, the deceased got injuries all over his body and\nultimately died.  A case as Crime No.38 of 1997 was registered and\nultimately closed finding it as a case of accidental death.  The\nappellants thereafter prayed for the award of compensation of Rs.4 lakhs\nwhich was disposed of by the Railway Claims Tribunal vide its judgment\ndated 29th October, 1998 holding the appellants entitled to the payment\nof Rs.2 lakhs by way of compensation for the untoward incident along\nwith interest at the rate of 15% per annum from the date of default.  In\nthe appeal before the Division Bench of the High Court the order of the\nTribunal awarding compensation was upheld and the appellants held\nentitled @ 12% per annum from 29.12.1997, the date of petition till\n29.11.1998.\n        After hearing the learned counsel for the parties and perusing the\nrecord, we have no doubt in our mind that the claim of the appellants is\nsquarely covered by the judgment of this Court in Rathi Menon’s case\n(supra) wherein while setting aside the similar judgment of the Kerala\nHigh Court, it was held:\n\"The asinine consequence of accepting the interpretation\nplaced by the Division Bench of the High Court can be\ndemonstrated through an illustration.  If a person sustained\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 3 \ninjury as described in Rule 3(2) of the Rules, in an\naccident in a train on 30.10.1997, and another person\nsustains the same kind of injury in another accident in a\ntrain the next day i.e. 1.11.1997, when both persons made\nseparate applications before the same Claims Tribunal for\ncompensation, the Tribunal can award Rs.2 lakhs only in the\nfirst case and Rs.4 lakhs in the second case.  What a woeful\ndiscrimination, if not a glaringly unfair differentiation.\nSee the interval between the two accidents of identical\nfeatures.  It was only a few hours, but the difference in\nthe compensation amount is enormously high.  any court\nshould avert an interpretation which would lead to such a\nmanifestly absurd fallout, unless the court is compelled\notherwise by any mandatory provision.\n        Why the Central Government decided to make such a vast\nvariation in the amount of compensation while exercising the\npowers conferred by Section 129 of the Act? It cannot be\nconceived that the Government wanted to make a\ndiscrimination between those victims who suffered an injury\nin an accident prior to 1.11.1997 and those who suffered an\nidentical injury in a similar accident on or after that\ndate.  The raison d’etre for making such variation is easily\ndiscernible.  the Central Government wanted to update the\ncompensation amount.  Rupee value is not an unchanging unit\nin the monetary system.  Students of economic history know\nthat currency value remained static before the Second World\nWar.  But the post-World War II witnessed the new phenomenon\nof vast fluctuations in money value of currency notes in\ncirculation in each nation.  When the US Dollar registered a\nsteep upward rise, currencies in many other countries made\ndownward slip.  What was the value of one hundred rupees\ntwenty years ago is vastly different from what it is today.\nThis substantial change has caused its impact on the cost of\nliving also.\n        The Central Government while changing the figures in\nthe compensation amount after an interval of a decade was\nonly influenced by the desire to update the money value of\nthe compensation.  In other words, what you were to pay ten\nyears ago to one person cannot be the same if it is paid\ntoday in the same figure of currency notes.  It is for the\npurpose of meeting the reality that the Central Government\nchanged the figures.\n        The unjust consequence resulting from the\ninterpretation which the Division Bench placed can be\ndemonstrated in another plane also.  If a person who\nsustained injury in a railway accident or in an untoward\nincident was disabled from making an application immediately\nand he makes the application a few years hence, is he to get\nthe compensation in terms of the money value which prevailed\non the date of the accident?  Suppose a Tribunal wrongly\ndismissed a claim after a few years of filing the\napplication and the claimant approaches the High Court in\nappeal.  As it happens quite often now, some High Court\ncould take up such an appeal only after the lapse of many\nyears and if the appeal is decided in favour of the claimant\nafter so many years, what a pity if the amount awarded is\nonly in terms of the figure indicated on the date of the\naccident.\n        From all these, we are of the definite opinion that\nthe Claims Tribunal must consider what the Rules prescribed\nat the time of making the order for payment of the\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 3 \ncompensation.\"\n        In view of authoritative pronouncement made by this Court under\nsimilar circumstances, the present appeal has to be allowed by setting\naside the impugned judgment of the High Court.  Consequently we direct\nthe Railway Administration to pay to the appellants a total sum of Rs.4\nlakhs instead of Rs.2 lakhs as awarded within a period of three months\nfrom the date of this judgment with interest as awarded by the High\nCourt.  If the amount of Rs.2 lakhs as awarded by the Tribunal has\nalready been paid, the appellants would be entitled to interest on the\nbalance amount of Rs.2 lakhs from the date of the petition till the\nactual payment and not on the whole amount as awarded by us.

In all these appeals, a common \nquestion of law has been raised by the parties. \nIt is, therefore, appropriate if we deal with \nand decide all the appeals by a common \njudgment. In all the three appeals, the claim \nof the claimant has been upheld finally by the \nNational Consumer Disputes Redressal \nCommission, New Delhi (’National Commission’ \nfor short) which has been challenged by the \nInsurance Company in this Court.\n3.              To appreciate the controversy, it \nwould be appropriate if we narrate the facts in \nthe first case i.e. New India Assurance Co. \nLtd. v. Prabhu Lal.\n4.              A complaint was filed by the \ncomplainant Prabhu Lal under Section 12 of the \nConsumer Protection Act, 1986 before the \nDistrict Consumer Disputes Redressal Forum, \nKota (Rajasthan) (’District Forum’ for short) \nclaiming compensation from the respondent \nInsurance Company as also from Tata Finance \nLimited, Jaipur. The case of the complainant \nwas that he purchased a vehicle\\027Tata 709 with \nRegistration No. RJ-20G-2828 from Tata Finance \nLimited, Jaipur. The insurance was taken from \nNew India Assurance Company effective from \nOctober 17, 1997 to October 16, 1998. Premium \namount of Rs.8235/- was duly paid. It was the \ncase of the complainant that on April 17, 1998, \nthe vehicle of the complainant was being driven \nby Mohd. Julfikar to Indore for getting Chilly. \nAt about 4.30 a.m. in the early morning, the \ndriver of Roadways Bus No. MP 13-C-3935 drove \nthe bus with very high speed in rash and \nnegligent manner which resulted in an accident \nat Yashwant Nagar. Due to said accident, Ram \nNarain\\027brother of the complainant who was \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 15 \nsitting with Mohd. Julfikar, sustained \ninjuries. Mohd. Julfikar immediately ran away \nleaving the vehicle but as Ram Narain received \nserious injuries, he could not come out of the \nvehicle. The complainant lodged First \nInformation Report (FIR) No. 131 of 1998 with \nthe Manpur Police Station, Yashwant Nagar, \nDistrict Indore under Sections 279 and 337 of \nthe Indian Penal Code (IPC) against driver Kalu \nof M.P. Roadways Bus. Vehicle of the \ncomplainant was then inspected by Tatas, \nestimate was prepared and claim was submitted \nin the prescribed form by the complainant to \nthe Insurance Company on June 12, 1998. The \namount of the claim was, however, not paid to \nthe complainant. The complainant, therefore, \nmoved the District Forum praying for an award \nof Rs.4,70,000/- towards the claim of vehicle, \nRs.15,000/- towards mental agony, Rs.5,000/- \ntowards driving charges of the vehicle from \nIndore to Kota and Rs.25,000/- for survey fee.\n5.              The Insurance Company filed its reply \nrefuting the claim of the complainant. \nAccording to the Company, it had not committed \nany deficiency in rendering ’service’. It was \nalso the case of the Company that it had \nfulfilled all contractual obligations as to \nclaim. The Company informed the complainant \nabout its decision on December 21, 1999 stating \nthat the claim was not allowable and the amount \nwas not payable. The Insurance Company, \ntherefore, prayed for the dismissal of the \ncomplaint.\n6.              According to the District Forum, the \nmain question was whether the Insurance Company \nwas deficient in rendering service and wrongly \ndisallowed insurance claim of the complainant. \nThe Forum considered the question and heard the \nparties. According the complainant, at the time \nof accident, vehicle was driven by Mohd. \nJulfikar who was having a licence to drive \nLight Motor Vehicle (LMV) as also Heavy Motor \nVehicle (HMV). In spite of it, the Insurance \nCompany disallowed the insurance claim of the \ncomplainant on the ground that the driver was \nnot having valid driving licence to drive the \nvehicle in question. It was also the contention \nof the complainant that certain documents \nproduced by the Insurance Company were not \ngenuine. The complainant was not an educated \nman and he knew only how to sign. If the \nofficials of Insurance Company had obtained \nsignatures of the complainant on certain \ndocuments without reading over to him and \nmaking him properly understood, the complainant \nshould not suffer. According to the \ncomplainant, Insurance Company wrongly presumed \nand proceeded on the basis that the vehicle was \ndriven by Ram Narain at the time of accident, \nwho was having a valid driving licence to drive \nonly Light Motor Vehicle and negatived the \nclaim. It was, therefore, prayed that an award \nbe passed in favour of the complainant.\n7.              The case of the Insurance Company, on \nthe other hand, was that the vehicle in \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 15 \nquestion, at the time of accident, was driven \nby Ram Narain, brother of the complainant. \nAdmittedly, Ram Narain was possessing licence \nto drive Light Motor Vehicle and not Heavy \nMotor Vehicle. He, therefore, could not have \ndriven Transport Vehicle in absence of \nnecessary endorsement as required and the \nInsurance Company could not be held liable. In \nthis connection, Insurance Company relied on \nthe permit issued by Transport Authority, the \nForm submitted by the complainant, licence \nissued and other documents. The Insurance \nCompany also relied upon FIR filed at Police \nStation, Manpur, wherein it was stated that the \nvehicle was driven by Ram Narain. Moreover, \nwhen the officers of the Insurance Company \napproached the complainant, they were informed \nby the complainant that the vehicle was driven \nby Ram Narain. As an after thought, only with a \nview to get the amount of compensation, it was \nasserted and a case had been put forward before \nthe Consumer Forum that the vehicle was driven \nby Mohd. Julfikar. It was contended that the \ncomplainant realized belatedly that if true \nfacts would be placed before the Forum, in view \nof legal position, he would not be able to get \nany amount from the Insurance Company. It was, \ntherefore, asserted that Mohd. Julfikar was \ndriving the vehicle but it was not true. The \nInsurance Company, hence, submitted that there \nwas no deficiency in rendering service by the \nCompany and the claim was liable to be \ndismissed.\n8.              The Tata Finance Limited, Jaipur in \nits reply stated that the complainant had \npurchased the vehicle on the basis of Hire \nPurchase Agreement and the amount was to be \npaid in instalments. At the time of incident, \nRs.3,65,026/- were due and payable to the \nCompany. Until the full amount was paid, the \nFinancer was to remain owner of the vehicle. It \nwas also stated that though Tata Finance \nCompany requested the Insurance Company several \ntimes to make payment of the balance hire \npurchase amount, it was not done.\n9.              The District Forum, after considering \nthe rival contentions of the parties and \nreferring to the case law on the point, \nparticularly a decision of this Court in Ashok \nGangadhar Maratha v. Oriental Insurance Co. \nLtd., (1999) 6 SCC 620, held that the \ncomplainant was not entitled to compensation. \nAccording to the District Forum, in Ashok \nGangadhar, this Court held that if the driver \nwas having effective driving licence to ply \nLight Motor Vehicle (LMV), he could not have \nplied Heavy Motor Vehicle (HMV) or Transport \nVehicle. The District Forum observed that from \nthe evidence on record, it was proved that at \nthe time of accident, Ram Narain was plying the \nvehicle in question and not Mohd. Julfikar as \nasserted. Ram Narain was having valid and \neffective driving licence to ply Light Motor \nVehicle and as such he could not have plied the \ntransport vehicle. The claim was, therefore, \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 4 of 15 \nnot tenable and accordingly the complaint was \ndismissed.\n10.             Being aggrieved by the order passed by \nthe District Forum, the claimant approached the \nConsumer Disputes Redressal Commission of \nRajasthan, Jaipur (’State Commission’ for \nshort). The State Commission held that the \nprinciple laid down in Ashok Gangadhar would \napply.  But according to the State Commission, \nthe District Forum was not right in dismissing \nthe claim observing that the said decision was \nagainst the complainant. In fact, the point was \ndecided in favour of the complainant and the \ncomplainant-claimant would be entitled to the \nbenefit of the judgment and the Insurance \nCompany must be held liable. Accordingly, the \nappeal was allowed. The order passed by the \nDistrict Forum was set aside and the Insurance \nCompany was ordered to pay the amount mentioned \nin the operative part of the judgment along \nwith interest at the rate of 15% p.a.\n11.             Aggrieved Insurance Company approached \nNational Forum against the order passed by the \nState Commission but the National Commission \nalso dismissed the Revision and confirmed the \norder passed by the State Commission.",

ETC.\nRESPONDENT:\nPATRICA JEAN MAHAJAN AND ORS. ETC. ETC.\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 08/07/2002\nBENCH:\nD.P. MOHAPATRA & BRIJESH KUMAR\nJUDGMENT:\nJUDGMENT\n2002 (3) SCR 1176\nThe Judgment of the Court was delivered by BRIJESH KUMAR, J. Leave granted.\nThe above noted four appeals arise out of the proceedings before the Motor\nAccident Claims Tribunal Tis Hazari, Delhi in Suit No. 325 of 1995. Since\nin all the appeals the judgment and order passed by the Division Bench of\nDelhi High Court has been challenged and the matters relate to the same\naccident, all these appeals have been heard together and they are being\ndisposed of by this order.\nThe brief facts are that Dr. Suresh K. Mahajan aged 47-48 years a medical\ngraduate went to America and established himself in the medical profession\nand became an American National. He established his own hospital in\nMichigan, U.S.A. He was on visit to India and on February 3, 1995 while\nproceeding to Jaipur from Delhi in a Maruti Car No. DL-4CB-1926 belonging\nto one of the two brothers travelling with him, a truck No. HR-29D-1125 hit\nthe rear part of the Maruti Car. Dr. Mahajan was sitting on the back seat\nwas injured and succumbed to his injuries. The Dependants of Dr. Suresh K.\nMahajan filed a petition under Section 166 of the Motor Vehicles Act for\ncompensation on account of death of Dr. Mahajan. According to the claimants\nDr. Mahajan had specialized in the field of Nephrology and had set up his\ngood practice and a hospital in Michigan U.S.A. According to the claimants,\nincome of the deceased was progressively increasing every year out of his\npractice and the hospital and in the year 1994 his income was to the tune\nof 9 lacs US dollars. At the time of his death Dr. Suresh K. Mahajan left\nbehind his wife Patrica Jean Mahajan, two daughters, a son and his parents\nresiding in Delhi. According to the claimants, he was providing good\neducation to his children and had also been sending a sum of Rs. 8,000 to\nhis parents in Delhi. A compensation for a sum of Rs. 54 crores was\nclaimed.\nThe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, after appreciation of the evidence and\nthe material on the record and on detailed discussion therefore, recorded\nthe finding that Dr. Mahajan received injuries and died because of the rash\nand negligent driving of the Troller No. HR 29-D-1125. So far the amount of\ncompensation is concerned, the Tribunal came to the conclusion that the\ncarry home income of the deceased was 3,09204 US Dollars. Out of which,\n2/3rd amount was set apart on account of self expenses of the deceased and\n1/3rd amount was held to be the amount of dependency which came to 1,03068\nUS Dollars. A multiplier of 7 was applied to arrive at the figure of\ncompensation, the amount came to 7,21,476 US Dollars, out of which\ndeduction on account of benefits of social security system/LIC was deducted\nwhich included an amount of 2,50,000 US Dollars received by the claimants\non account of personal life insurance of Dr. Mahajan. The other amounts\npaid to Mrs. Mahajan and two of her children on account of social security\ncoming to a sum of 51,300 US Dollars were also deducted. The Tribunal\ndeducted a total amount of 3,22,900 dollars. Applying the exchange rate of\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 15 \nRs. 30 a sum of Rs. 1.19 crores was awarded with interest at the rate of\n12% from the date of filing of the petition up to the date of payment, the\ntotal amount thus come to about Rs. 1.62 crores.\nThe claimants approached the High Court in appeal. The learned Single Judge\nfound that carry home income of the deceased was 3,39,445 US Dollars and\nout of the said amount, l/3rd of it instead of 2/3rd was liable to be\ndeducted on account of self expenditure of the deceased, the amount of\ndependency thus, was fixed at 226297 US dollars. The learned Single Judge\napplied the multiplier of 10 and disallowed any deductions on account of\nsocial security system. The same rate of interest was maintained as awarded\nbut the rate of exchange at Rs. 47/- was applied being the current rate as\nthen prevailing. The total amount of compensation thus arrived at, came to\nRs. 10.38 crores. The FAO No. 273 of 1998 preferred by the claimants was\nthus allowed in the manner indicated above. And the appeal preferred by the\nUnited India Insurance company Ltd. FAO No. 366 of 1998 was dismissed with\nan observation that there was no scope to disturb the finding of the\nTribunal on the question of negligence of offending troller/driver. The\nparties preferred three Letters Patent Appeals before the Division Bench,\nwhich have been decided by the judgment and order dated 17.10.2001. The LPA\nNo. 179 of 2001, preferred by Patrica Mahajan, and LPA No. 225 of 2001 and\n236 of 2001 had been filed by the United Insurance Company Ltd. challenging\nthe amount of compensation as awarded by the learned Single Judge and also\nthe order upholding the finding of rash and negligent driving on the part\nof driver of the troller. By means of impugned judgment, the Division Bench\nmaintained the order passed by the learned Single Judge but for application\nof multiplier and the exchange rate. In so far it related to exchange rate\nof Dollar, the Division Bench observed that it was a closed chapter since\nthe amount awarded by the Tribunal at the exchange rate of Rs. 30 was\nwithdrawn by the claimants and the exchange rate of Rs. 47 as awarded by\nthe Single Judge was disallowed. The Division Bench applied the mutiplier\nof 13 according to second schedule to the Act referable to Section 163A of\nthe Act. It was found that there was no reason not to follow the schedule\nwhich has been held by the Supreme Court to be safe guide to arrive at the\namount of just compensation. In the result, the total amount i.e. principal\nwith interest came to about Rs. 16.12 crores.\nThe above noted appeals have been filed against the judgment of the\nDivision Bench, the United Insurance Company Ltd. raising a grievance\nagainst application of multiplier of 13 and disallowance of deduction on\naccount of social security system. They also feel aggrieved by award of\ninterest at the rate of 12% per annum. In one of the appeals preferred by\nthe United India Insurance Company the finding of rash and negligent\ndriving on the part of driver of the troller has also been sought to be\nchallenged. In the appeal preferred by the claimants, conversion rate of\nDollar in terms of Rupees has been asked @ Rs. 47 as was awarded by the\nlearned Single Judge.\nWe may first take up the question of application of appropriate multiplier\nin the facts and circumstances of this case. The multiplier of 13, has been\napplied by the Division Bench of the High Court strictly following the\nSecond Schedule to the Act referable to Section 163A of the Act. The\nPetition was filed by the claimant for award of compensation under Section\n166 of the Motor Vehicles Act. Before adverting to the case law on the\npoint cited by the learned counsel for both the sides, it may be beneficial\nto peruse the two provisions indicated above. Section 163A as inserted by\nAct 54 of 1994 w.e.f. 14.11.1994 reads as under:-\n\"163A. Special Provisions as to payment of compensation on structured\nformula basis.-(1) Notwithstanding anything contained in this Act or in any\nother law for the time being in force or instrument having the force of\nlaw, the owner of the motor vehicle of the authorised insurer shall be\nliable to pay in the case of death or permanent disablement due to accident\narising out of the use of motor vehicle, compensation, an indicated in the\nSecond Schedule, to the legal heirs or the victim, as the case may be.\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 15 \nExplanation.-For the purposes of this sub-section, \"permanent disability\"\nshall have the same meaning and extent as in the Workmen’s Compensation\nAct, 1923 (8 of the 1923).\n(2) In any claim for compensation under sub-section (1), the claimant shall\nnot be required to plead or establish that the death or permanent\ndisablement in respect of which the claim has been made was due to any\nwrongful act or neglect or default of the owner of the vehicle/ or vehicles\nconcerned or of any other person.\n(3)  The Central Government may, keeping in view the cost of living by\nnotification in the Official Gazette, from time to time amend the Second\nSchedule.\"\nThe noticeable features of this provision are that it provides for\ncompensation in the case of death or permanent disablement due to accident\narising out of use of Motor Vehicle. The amount of compensation would be as\nindicated in the Second Schedule. The claimant is not required to plead or\nestablish that the death or permanent disablement was due to any wrongful\nact or negligence or default of the owner of the vehicle or any other\nperson. Award of compensation according to Schedule under this provision is\nalso known as structured formula.\nSection 166 reads as under:-\n\"Application for compensation-(1) An application for compensation arising\nout of an accident of the nature specified in sub-section (1) of section\n165 may be made-\n(a)    by the person who has sustained the injury; or\n(b)    by the owner of the property; or\n(c)    where death has resulted from the accident, by all or any of the\nlegal representatives of the deceased",

REBELLO & ORS.\n        Vs.\nRESPONDENT:\nMAHARASHTRA STATE ROAD TRANSPORT CORPN.  & ANR.\nDATE OF JUDGMENT:       18/09/1998\nBENCH:\nK.  VENKATASWAMI, A.P.  MISRA.\nACT:\nHEADNOTE:\nJUDGMENT:\nJUDGMENT\n--------\nMISRA, J.\n--------\nThe question raised in this appeal is of great importance on\nwhich the  High  Courts in India are divided.  Importance of\nthis question is underlined and revealing since 19^  century\nwhere  there  is  full  debate  in the English Courts having\ndivergent views leading to legislation and amendments to set\nat rest  this  controversy.    So  far  as  our  country  is\nconcerned,  as  aforesaid,  we  have  divergent views of the\nvarious High Courts, but so  far  this  Court,  it  has  not\ndwelled this question in depth, except passing references in\na few cases to which we shall be reining later.\nThe question  is.   whether the life insurance money\nof the deceased  is  to  be  deducted  from  the  claimants’\ncompensation  receivable under the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939?\nThe  minimum  matrix  of  the  facts   to   appreciate   the\ncontroversy is stated hereunder:\nThe husband of appellant No.1, father of  appellants\nNos.2  to  6,  was  travelling in the Maharashtra State Road\nTransport Corporation bus from Rathare  Badruk  to  Pune  on\n12th April,  1973  at  about 4.00 P.M.  when this bus passed\nthe  village  Umbraj  and  came  near  village  Kotri   near\nmilestone No.   89/4, Karnataka State Transport bus was seen\ncoming from the opposite direction, i.e., from  Satara  side\ntowards Kolhapur.    The  drivers  of the two buses were not\nable to control their buses resulting into collision between\nthe two, seriously injuring the deceased clemant Rebello and\nMr.  Vincy John Pereira, in which Rebello received  multiple\nfractures and  died  on  the  spot.   The appellants filed a\nSpecie Civil Suit No.  24 of 1975 against the aforesaid  two\nState Road  Transport  Corporations.   It was averred in the\nplaint that the deceased was aged about 40 years and was the\nsole bread winner of the family.  He was a well  known  boat\nbuilder and  businessman  of  the  Bassein.    He  was doing\nbusiness in partnership under the name and style  of  Marine\nEngineering Works.   He was a person of great skill and hard\nworker.  He was a person of robust health and sober  habits.\nHis  income from the business and other activities was about\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 18 \nRs- 40,000/- per annum.  He was assessed for  an  income  of\nabout  Rs.43,000/-  by  the  Income  Tax Authorities for the\nAssessment Year 1971-72.  Being the sole  bread  winner,  he\nused to provide the family with the support of Rs.25,000/per\nyear.     The    claim    made   by   the   appellants   for\ndamages/compensation under the various admissible  heads  of\ndamages was for  Rs.    4 lacs.  The claim of the appellants\nwas allowed by the Civil  Judge,  Senior  Division,  Satara,\nholding  that the death was caused due to rash and negligent\ndriving on the  part  of  the  driver  of  respondent  No.2,\nnamely, Karnataka  Road  Transport  Coloration.  It was also\nheld that the deceased had  supported  his  family  with  an\namount ofRs.25,OOOA  per  annum.    It was found that as the\ndeceased was of 40 years old at the time of  his  death  and\nhis  father  had  lived upto the age of 85 years, the normal\nlongevity of his life would have been 25 years from the date\nof death, but since the claimants had claimed a compensation\nonly taking a period of 20 years, the Trial court held  that\nthe   appellants   were   entitled   to  a  compensation  of\nRs3,80,000/by  way  of  pecuniary  loss  and  Rs.l0,000/  on\naccount  of  pain  and  suffering,  in  total  Rs.3,90,000/^\nHowever, in view of  the  Division  Bench  judgment  of  the\nBombay  High  Court  in Jaikumar Chhaganlal Patni and Others\nvs.  Many Jerome D’souza and others (AIR 1978  Bombay  239),\nthe  Trial  court  deducted  the  amount  of  life insurance\nreceived by the appellants to the  tune  of  Rs.3,15,067.95p\nfrom  the  aforesaid  compensation  calculated and held that\nonly the balance amount of Rs.74,939.05p  with  interest  at\nthe  rate  of  six  per  cent  per  annum  is payable by the\nrespondent No.2 to the claimants.\nThrough  the  witness  Shashikant  Dattatraya  Kale,\nExhibit 67, who  was  serving  in  LIC  at  Bombay,  it  was\nelicited  that  the  deceased  clement  had insured his life\nunder the said policy.  The claimants were entitled  to  get\nan  amount  of  Rs.4,40193.65p,  out  of  which an amount of\nRs.l,52,125.70p was deducted by way of estate duty  and  the\nremaining   amount   of  Rs.3,15,067.95p  was  paid  to  the\naforesaid heirs.  It is this amount, as aforesaid, which was\ndeducted in view of the decision of the  Bombay  High  Court\nreferred to  above.    On  appeal,  preferred  both  by  the\nappellants and also the respondents, the High Court rejected\nthe cross appeal of  respondent  No  .2,  namely,  Karnataka\nState Road Transport Corporation.  However, the appeal (No..\n209/81)  of  the appellants was dismissed as it could not be\npressed in view of the decision of the Bombay High Court, as\naforesaid.  It is against this  judgment,  this  appeal  has\nbeen preferred by the appellants.\nAt  the  outset,  learned counsel, appearing for the\nrespondents made a preliminary objection that this appeal is\nnot maintainable since the appeal  in  the  High  Court  was\ndismissed as  not pressed.  We have no difficulty in holding\nthat this preliminary objection of the  respondents  has  no\nmerit.   We find that the High Court had rejected the appeal\nwith the following observation:\n        \"As regards the other appeal, bearing No.209\n        of 1981, Mr.  Chaphkar, the learned counsel for the\n        appellants, has urged that  in  view  of  the  (Full\n        Bench) decision of this Court, he does not press the\n        appeal as the same does not survive.\"\n        (Full Bench, was wrongly recorded for\n        the Division Bench)\nThis  only  reveals  that  since  the  question   of\ndeduction,   as  aforesaid  being  covered  by  the  earlier\ndecision of the same court, he could not press the point  in\nthat appeal  in  that  court.    It  is  for this reason the\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 18 \nappellants  challenge  this  point   before   us   for   our\nconsideration.\nIn this case, we are not concerned with the question\nof compensation assessed under the Motor Vehicles Act as the\nsame is not under challenge before us.  This became final as\nthe cross objections filed by respondent No.2 were dismissed\nby  the  High  Court  which  challenged  the fixation of the\nquantum  of  compensation  against  which  no   appeal   was\npreferred by  the  respondents.   This leaves us to the only\nquestion for adjudication, as aforesaid, whether  out:    of\nthe  compensation amount payable to the appellants under the\nMotor  Vehicles  Act  1939,  the  money  received   by   the\nappellants  on  account  of  life  insurance  policy  of the\ndeceased, is deductible or not which has been  done  in  the\npresent case through the impugned order?\nAdverting to the said Bombay High Court decision  in\nthe  case of Jaikumar (supra), we find that it refers to the\ntwo sets of decisions of the various High Courts  in  India.\nOne  set,  holding that life insurance money received by the\nheirs ought to be deducted and the other set, holding not to\ndeduct from.  the compensation payable under  the  aforesaid\nAct.   The case of Jaikumar (supra), which is the foundation\nof the  present  appellants  being  deprived  of  the  total\ncompensation,   the   contention  therein  was,  the  amount\nreceived towards life  insurance  policy  is  the  pecuniary\nadvantage  received  by  the claimant by reason of the death\nhence liable to be deducted in terms of  the  ratio  in  the\ncase of Gobald Motor case (AIR 1962 S.C.I), Jaikumar (supra)\nholds:\n        \"....   Judicial  opinion is also sharply divided on\n        the question whether life policy amount can be  said\n        to have come to the claimants by reason of the death\n        of  the  deceased  to justify its deduction from the\n        amount of  compensation  payable  to  the  claimants\n        towards their  pecuniary  loss.    Our attention was\n        drawn by Mr.  Zaveri the learned  advocate  for  the\n        respondents,  to  a few judgements of the High Court\n        of Gujarat in LIC of India V.  Naranbhai  Munjabhai,\n        1973 ACC  CJ 226:  (AIR 1973 Guj 216), High Court of\n        Punjab and Haryana in Sood and Company  v.    Surjit\n        Kaur,  1973  Acc CJ 414, as also Delhi High Court in\n        Bhagwanti Devi v.  Ish Kumar, 1975  Acc  CJ  56  and\n        several  other  judgments of same High Courts, which\n        do support his contention that amounts  so  received\n        are  not liable to be deducted as the same cannot be\n        said to have come to the claimants by reason of  the\n        death of the  deceased.  Mr.  Dwivedee, on the other\n        band, drew our attention to the  judgments  reported\n        in Union of  India  v.  S.  Ghosh, AIR 1973 Pat 129,\n        Sushila Devi v.  lbrahim, AIR  1974  Madh  Pra  181;\n        Sabha Pati  v.    Rameshwar  Singh,  1973 Acc CJ 319\n        (Orissa High  Court)  and  Automobiles  Transport  v\n        Dewalal  AIR 1977 Raj 121, and a few other judgments\n        of the same courts taking the contrary view.",

The   vehicle  in  question   was\nregistered  as a public carrier vehicle used for hire by the\npassengers.    This   vehicle    was    insured   with   the\nrespondent-Insurance Company.  On 22nd of March, 1995, it is\nstated  that  some unknown passengers hired the  above  auto\nrickshaw  from rickshaw stand at Dimapur between 5 to 6 p.m.\nIt  is  also not in dispute that the said auto rickshaw  was\nreported  stolen and the dead body of driver Dasarath  Singh\nwas  recovered  by  the  police on the next  day,  the  auto\nrickshaw  was never recovered and the claim of the owner for\nthe   loss   of   auto  rickshaw   was   accepted   by   the\nrespondent-Insurance  Company  and a sum of Rs.47,220/-  was\nsettled by the said company towards the loss suffered by the\nowner.  One Darshan Singh claiming to be a Power of Attorney\nholder  of  the  present appellants filed a  claim  petition\nalong with the present appellants under Section 163 A of the\nMotor  Vehicles  Act,  1988 (for short the  Act)  claiming\ndamages  for the death caused to the deceased Dasarath Singh\nduring  the course of his employment under Lalit Singh as  a\ndeath  caused  in  an  accident arising out of  the  use  of\nvehicle.   The Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, Nagaland  as\nper  its  judgment  dated  24th of June, 1996  came  to  the\nconclusion that the death of the driver of the auto rickshaw\n(Dasarath Singh) was caused by an accident coming within the\npurview  of the Motor Vehicles Act, therefore, held that the\nowner  of the vehicle was liable to compensate the death  of\nthe  driver  in money value.  Since there was  an  agreement\nbetween  the  vehicle  owner  and  the  respondent-Insurance\nCompany  to  compensate  the employer of the  vehicle,  said\nlegal   and  statutory  liability   stood  fastened  on  the\nrespondent-Insurance  Company.  The tribunal also held  that\nthe  quantum of claim of the claimants stood established and\nconsequently  it awarded a sum of Rs.2,81,500/- against  the\nInsurance  Company with interest @ 12% on the amount awarded\nfrom  the  date of application till payment.  The  Insurance\nCompany  preferred  an appeal by itself before  the  Gauhati\nHigh  Court  (Kohima Bench) in M.A.(F) No.8(K)96.  The  High\nCourt  by its judgment dated 9.3.1998 came to the conclusion\nthat  there was no motor accident as contemplated under  the\nAct.   The High Court further held that the case in hand was\na  case  of murder and not of an accident, hence a  petition\nfor  claim  under the provisions of the Act did  not  arise.\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 6 \nThe  High  Court,  accordingly, allowed the appeal  and  set\naside  the  judgment  and the award made  by  the  tribunal.\nOriginally, the above mentioned Power of Attorney holder had\npreferred  the above appeal making the wife and children  of\nthe  deceased  as proforma respondents along with the  other\nrespondent.   By  an  order  of this  Court  dated  18th  of\nFebruary, 2000, this Court felt that to protect the interest\nof  the  heirs of the deceased the wife and children of  the\ndeceased  should  be first impleaded as appellants  to  this\nappeal  and  the cause-title be amended, which  having  been\ndone  and  notice  being issued, the  respondent-  Insurance\nCompany  is  represented  before  us.   We  have  heard  the\nparties.   Leave granted.  On behalf of the appellants, Shri\nAnurabh Chowdhury contends that the deceased was employed to\ndrive  the auto rickshaw for ferrying passengers on hire and\non  the  fateful  day the auto rickshaw was  parked  at  the\nrickshaw  stand  at Dimapur and at about 5 to 6  p.m.   some\nunknown  passengers  had engaged the said auto rickshaw  for\ntheir  journey towards Singrijan area and thereafter nothing\nwas known of the driver or rickshaw.  It is only on the next\nday  that  the authorities were able to recover the body  of\nthe  deceased  and the auto rickshaw in question  was  never\ntraced  till  date.   The owner of the  auto  rickshaw  has,\ntherefore, been compensated by the Insurance Company for the\nloss of the said auto rickshaw, therefore, the murder of the\ndeceased  Dasarath  Singh  squarely comes  within  the  word\ndeath  due  to  accident arising out of the use  of  motor\nvehicle  found in Section 163A(1) of the Act.   Consequently\nthe  tribunal  was  justified in awarding  the  compensation\nclaimed by the appellants.  He contended the word accident\nhas  not  been defined under the Motor Vehicles Act and  the\nsaid   Act  being  a   beneficial  legislation,  a   liberal\ninterpretation  should be given so as to achieve the objects\nof  the  Act.   He  contended that  the  deceased  being  an\nemployee  was entitled for compensation both under the Motor\nVehicles  Act and also under the Workmens Compensation Act,\n1923.  However, under Section 167 of the Motor Vehicles Act,\nthe  heirs  of  the deceased had a choice  either  to  claim\ncompensation   under  that  Act  or  under   the   Workmens\nCompensation  Act.   The appellants having chosen to  invoke\nthe  provisions of the Motor Vehicles Act, the Tribunal  was\nwholly  justified  in awarding the compensation,  while  the\nHigh  Court, according to him, without properly appreciating\nthe  reasonings adopted by the tribunal has interfered  with\nthe  just order of the tribunal.  He also contends that  the\nappeal  filed by the Insurance Company was not  maintainable\nfor  not  having  obtained  the leave  of  the  tribunal  as\nrequired  under  Section  170 of the Act.  He  relies  on  a\njudgment  of  this Court in the case of Shankarayya  &  Anr.\nvs.  United India Insurance Co.  Ltd.  & Anr.  (1998 (3) SCC\n140).   Ms.Pankaj  BalaVerma, appearing for the  respondent-\nInsurance   Company   does   not   in   fact   dispute   the\nmaintainability  of  the  petition filed by  the  appellants\nunder  Section  163A of the Motor Vehicles Act but  contends\nthat  the  meaning  ascribed to the word accident  in  the\nWorkmens Compensation Act by judicial pronouncements cannot\nbe  applied to the word accident in the Motor Vehicles Act\nbecause  the  object  of the two Acts  are  different.   She\nsupported  the judgment of the High Court by contending that\non  the facts of the present appeal, the death of the driver\nof the auto rickshaw was caused by felonious acts of certain\nunknown  persons  and the same is not caused by an  accident\narising  out  of  the  use of the  vehicle.   Regarding  the\nmaintainability  of the appeal, she submits the judgment  of\nthis  Court  was  reported  subsequent  to  the  High  Court\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 6 \nJudgment,  hence  no fault could be found with the  impugned\njudgment  on  that score and no such objection was taken  in\nregard  to  the maintainability before the High  Court.   As\npointed  out by the learned counsel for the appellants,  the\nMotor  Vehicles  Act  does not define the  word  accident.\nHowever, Section 163A of the Motor Vehicles Act provides for\npayment  of compensation for the death or injury suffered in\na  motor  vehicle accident on a structured formula basis  in\nSection  163  A  of  the Act.  Sub-clause (I)  of  the  said\nSection says that notwithstanding anything contained in this\nAct  or  in  any other law for the time being  in  force  or\ninstrument  having the force of law, the owner of the  motor\nvehicle  or the authorised insurer shall be liable to pay in\nthe  case of death or permanent disablement due to  accident\narising  out  of the use of motor vehicle, compensation,  as\nindicated  in the Second Schedule, to the legal heirs or the\nvictim,  as  the case may be;  Sub-section (2) of  the  said\nSection  also provides, in any claim for compensation  under\nthat  sub-section,  the  claimant shall not be  required  to\nplead  or establish that the death or permanent  disablement\nin  respect of which the claim has been made was due to  any\nwrongful  act  or  neglect or default of the  owner  of  the\nvehicle  or  vehicles  concerned  or  of  any  other  person\n(emphasis  supplied).   A conjoint reading of the above  two\nsub-clauses of Section 163A shows that a victim or his heirs\nare  entitled  to claim from the owner/Insurance  Company  a\ncompensation for death or permanent disablement suffered due\nto  accident  arising  out of the use of the  motor  vehicle\n(emphasis supplied), without having to prove wrongful act or\nneglect  or default of any one.  Thus it is clear, if it  is\nestablished  by the claimants that the death or  disablement\nwas  caused  due  to an accident arising out of the  use  of\nmotor  vehicle  then  they will be entitled for  payment  of\ncompensation.   In  the present case, the contention of  the\nInsurance  Company  which was accepted by the High Court  is\nthat  the  death  of the deceased (Dasarath Singh)  was  not\ncaused  by  an  accident  arising out of the  use  of  motor\nvehicle.",

The appellant suffered serious injuries in the bead \nG \non collision of the car and a motor lorry resulting in 100% disability and H \n75 \n76 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1995] 1 S.C.R. \nA paraplegia below the waist. Notices given to the Insurance Company and \nother parties liable to pay compensation resulted in no response so the \nappellant filed a claim petition u/s 110-A of the Motor Vehicles Act, 1939 \non 13.11.1980. \nB \nThe appellant was a practising advocate who used to appear in the \nHigh Court and Supreme Court of India. He was also a Judge of the City \nCivil Court for some time until he resigned in 1964. Because of the \naccident, he became disabled and was unable to resume bis practice. \nThe owner of the lorry resisted his liability to pay any compensation \nC on the ground that the vehicle was insured and so the insurance company \nwas liable to pay compensation, if any, to the appellant. The owner of the \ncar resisted the claim asserting that the accident took place entirely due \nto the negligence of the driver of the motor lorry. In any case, according \nto the respondent, the compensation claimed was excessive, imaginary and \nspeculative in nature. \nD \nThe Accident Claims Tribunal passed an Award directing respon-\ndeats 1 and 2 to pay jointly and severally Rs. 26,25,992 with interest at the \nrate of 12% per annum from the date of the application till payment. The \ninsurer of the motor lorry was liable to pay Rs. 50,000 and interest thereon \nE and the insurer of the car was directed to pay all the compensation along \nwith interest on behalf of respondent No. 1. The Tribnnal was of the view \nthat there was composite negligence on the part of the drivers of both \nvehicles. \nF \nG \nTwo appeals were tiled against the award, one on behalf of the \nappellant for enhancement of the compensation and the other on behalf of \nthe owner of the car and its insurance company questioning the validity \nand correctness of the award. The High Conrt rednced the compensation \nfrom Rs. 26,25,992 to Rs. 8,57,352 and the rate of interest to 6% per annnm. \nAgainst this the present appeals and S.L.P. have been filed. \nDisposing the matter, this Court \nHELD : 1.1 Any damage cansed by negligent condnct is generally \nactionable irrespective of the kind of activity out of which the damage \narose. Any person nsing the road as a motorist will be liable, if by his \nH action be negligently canses physical injuries to any body else. In the \nR.D. HATIAl'/GADI v. PEST CONTROL (I) PVf. LTD. 77 \ninstant case, the fact that the front Iert side of the car was entangled with A \nthe front middle of the lorry indicated about the rashness on the part of \nthe drivers of the two vehicles. \n1.2. While fixing an amount of compensation payable to a victim of \nan accident, the damages have to be assessed separately as pecuniary \ndamages and special damages. Pecuniary damages are those which the B \nvictim bas actually incurred and which is capable of being calculated in \nterms of money, whereas non-pecuniary damages are those which are \nincapable of being assessed by arithmetical calculations. In order to \nappreciate the two concepts, pecuniary damages may include expenses \nincurred by the claimant on account or : (i) medical attendance (ii) loss of C \nearning of profit upto the date or trial; (iii) other material loss. So far as \nnon-pecuniary damages are concerned, they may include (i) damages for \nmental and physical shock, pain and suffering, already suffered or likely \nto be sulTered in future; (ii) damages to compensate for the loss of \namenities ·of life which inay include a variety or matters i.e. on account of \ninjury the claimant may not be able to walk, run or sit; (iii) damages for D \nthe loss of expectation of life, i.e. on account of injury the normal longevity \nof the person concerned is shortened; (iv) inconvenience, hardship, dis-\ncomfort, disaP1>oiutment, frustration and mental stress iu life. \n1.3. Whenever a tribunal or a court is required to fill the amount of E \ncompensation iu cases of accident, it involves some guess work, some \nhypothetical consideration, some amount of sympathy linked with the \nnature of the disability caused. But all these elements have to be viewed \nwith objective standards. \nWard v. James, [1965] 1 All E.R. 563 and C.K Subramonia Iyer and F \nOrs. v. V.T. Kunhikuttan Nair and Ors., AIR (1970) SC 376, reli~ on. \n1.4. In the instant case the appellant had claimed Rs. 37,688 for \nAyurvedic treatment against which an amount of Rs. 4,000 had been rightly \nallowed by the High Court. The appellant's claim 'for Rs. 21,000 for G \nFowler's Bed for the present and Rs. 21,000 for the future, Rs. 50,000 for \nelectric wheel chair for the present and Rs. 50,000 for the future. Rs. 5,000 \nfor Air Inflated Bed for the present and Rs. 5,000 for the future are \nallowed. For Home Attendants, the appellant claimed Rs. 55,450 for the \npresent and Rs. 1,87,200 for the future. The High Court allowed 36,000 and \nRs. 72,000 respectively. There was no occasion for the High Court to be so H \n78 SUPREME COURT REPORTS (1995) 1 S.C.R. \nA mathematical on this question. Under the circnmstances prevailing in the \nsociety in respect of Home Attendants, the High Court shonld have allowed \nthe amount as claimed by the appellant. For Drugs and Tablets (Al· \nlopathic), the claim had been made for Rs. 9,000 for the present and Rs. \n18,000 for the future. The High Court bad allowed Rs. 5,400 and Rs. 10,800 \nB \nc \nrespectively. The claim under this head appeared to be reasonable and \nshould have been allowed. Against the appellant's claim for Ayllrvedic \ntreatment for Rs. 7,800 for the present and Rs. 37,440 for the future, the \nHigh Court rightly allowed Rs. 7,200 and Rs. 12,000 respectively. Bedsore \nDressing Charges for the present and future were claimed respectively at \nRs. 72,900 and Rs. 1,29,000 against which the High Court rightly directed \npayment of Rs. 20,000 and Rs. 10,000. The High Court rightly allowed Rs. \n10,000 for the present and Rs. 5,000 for the future for Cathetarisation. Rs. \n20,100 bad been claimed as charges for consulting Surgeons for the present \nand Rs. 14,400 for the future. The High Court rightly allowed Rs. 5,000 for \nthe present and the same amount for the future. For physiotherapy Rs. \nD 34,200 were claimed for the present and Rs. 1,87,200 for the future. The \nHigh Court allowed Rs. 12,000 for the present and Rs. 12,000 for the future. \nIt is well known that for victims of road accidents, physiotherapy is one of \nthe acknowledged modes of treatment which bas to be pursued for a long \nduration. The High Court should have allowed Rs. 34,200 as claimed by \nthe appellant for the present and atleast Rs. 50,000 for the future. In \nE respect of loss of earnings a claim had been made for Rs. 1,80,000 but the \nHigh Court allowed Rs. 1,44,000. The High Court should have allowed the \nwhole claim. For loss of future earning a claim bad been made at Rs. \n3,60,000. The High Court rightly allowed Rs. 1,62,000, as it is a reasonable \namount to be awarded taking all facts and circumstances in respect of the \nF future earnings of the appellant. \n1.5. When compensation is to be awarded for pain and suffering and \nloss of life, the special circumstances of the claimant have to be taken into \naccount including bis age, the unusual deprivation be bas suffered, the \neffect thereof on his future life etc.",

K. Sema & Markandey Katju\nJUDGMENT:\nJ U D G M E N T\nREPORTABLE\nMARKANDEY KATJU, J.\n1.      This appeal by special leave has been filed against the impugned \njudgment of a Division Bench of the Kerala High Court dated 25.6.2001 \npassed in MFA No. 1080 of 1998-B.\n2.      Heard learned counsel for the parties and perused the record.\n3.      The facts of the case are that a claim petition was filed before the \nRailway Claims Tribunal, Ernakulam Bench (hereinafter referred to as the \n’Tribunal’) by the husband, mother and minor son of one Smt. Abja who died \non 23.5.1996 in a train accident at Varkala Railway station.  The Claims \nTribunal disallowed the claim, but the appeal against the said decision was \nallowed by the Kerala High Court by the impugned judgment dated \n25.6.2001 and compensation of Rs. 2 lacs with interest @ 12% from the date \nof the petition till the date of payment was granted.  Aggrieved, this appeal \nhas been filed by the appellant.   \n4.      There is no dispute that Smt. Abja was a bona fide passenger holding \na second class season ticket and an identity card issued by the Southern \nRailway.  As per the forensic report the cause of death was due to multiple \ninjuries due to the accident.  The deceased fell on to the railway track and \nwas run over by train No.6349 Parasuram Express.  \n5.      The Tribunal found that Smt. Abja was a bona fide passenger \ntraveling by the train.\n6.      Before the Tribunal PW-2, K. Rajan, deposed that while he was at \nVarkala railway station he found one passenger falling from the Parasuram \nExpress and that the train had stopped.  He further stated in his evidence that \nhe went to the north side of the platform and saw the injured lying on the \nplatform. He further stated that the person falling down was the lady who \ndied on the spot.  He also stated that the deceased fell down from the \ncompartment of the train when the train was moving.\n7.      The Tribunal strangely enough held that PW-2 was an interested \nwitness because if he was present on the spot he would have definitely \nhelped the Station Master in removing the dead body from the railway track.  \nFurther, the police would have definitely recorded his evidence.  For this \nreason, the Tribunal disbelieved the evidence of PW-2.  We are, however, of \nthe opinion that there was no good reason to disbelieve PW-2 because there \nis nothing to show that he had any motive to give false evidence, or that he \nwas an interested witness.  Further, his evidence could not have been \ndiscarded merely because he did not go to the spot and help removing the \ndead body from the railway track.  Moreover, merely because the police did \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 9 \nnot record his statement does not mean that he was not present or gave false \nevidence.  It is common knowledge that in our country often there is a large \ncrowd on railway platforms, and it is simply not possible for the police to \ntake the statement of everyone there.\n8.       However, the evidence of DW-1, D. Sajjan, who was the Station \nMaster at the railway station corroborates the evidence of PW-2.  DW-1 had \ndeposed that he saw one girl running towards the train and trying to enter the \ntrain and she fell down.  He has further stated that the deceased Abja had \nattempted to board the train and fell down from the running train.  For this \nreason, the Tribunal held that this was not an ’untoward incident’ within the \nmeaning of the expression in Section 123(c) of the Railways Act, 1989 as it \nwas not an accidental falling of a passenger from a train carrying passengers.\n9.      In appeal, the Kerala High Court was of the view that the deceased \nsustained injuries, even according to the respondents, in her anxiety to get \ninto the train which was moving.  Hence, the High Court held that the \ndeceased came within the expression ’accidental falling of a passenger from \na train carrying passengers’ which is an ’untoward incident’, as defined in \nSection 123(c) of the Railways Act, 1989.\n10.     We are of the opinion that it will not legally make any difference \nwhether the deceased was actually inside the train when she fell down or \nwhether she was only trying to get into the train when she fell down.   In our \nopinion in either case it amounts to an ’accidental falling of a passenger from \na train carrying passengers’.  Hence, it is an ’untoward incident’ as defined in \nSection 123(c) of the Railways Act.\n11.     No doubt, it is possible that two interpretations can be given to the \nexpression ’accidental falling of a passenger from a train carrying \npassengers’, the first being that it only applies when a person has actually got \ninside the train and thereafter falls down from the train, while the second \nbeing that it includes a situation where a person is trying to board the train \nand falls down while trying to do so.  Since the provision for compensation \nin the Railways Act is a beneficial piece of legislation, in our opinion, it \nshould receive a liberal and wider interpretation and not a narrow and \ntechnical one.  Hence in our opinion the latter of the abovementioned two \ninterpretations i.e. the one which advances the object of the statute and \nserves its purpose should be preferred vide Kunal Singh vs. Union of India \n(2003) 4 SCC 524(para 9), B. D. Shetty vs. CEAT Ltd. (2002) 1 SCC 193 \n(para 12), Transport Corporation of India vs. ESI Corporation (2000) 1 \nSCC 332 etc.\n12.     It is well settled that if the words used in a beneficial or welfare \nstatute are capable of two constructions, the one which is more in \nconsonance with the object of the Act and for the benefit of the person for \nwhom the Act was made should be preferred.   In other words, beneficial or \nwelfare statutes should be given a liberal and not literal or strict \ninterpretation vide Alembic Chemical Works Co. Ltd. vs. The Workmen \nAIR 1961 SC 647( para 7), Jeewanlal Ltd. vs. Appellate Authority  AIR \n1984 SC 1842 (para 11), Lalappa Lingappa and others vs. Laxmi Vishnu \nTextile Mills Ltd. AIR 1981 SC 852 (para 13), S. M. Nilajkar vs. Telecom \nDistt. Manager (2003) 4 SCC 27(para 12) etc.\n13.     In Hindustan Lever Ltd. vs. Ashok Vishnu Kate and others \n1995(6) SCC 326 (vide para 42) this Court observed:\n        \"In this connection, we may usefully turn to the \ndecision of this Court in Workmen vs. American Express \nInternational Banking Corporation wherein Chinnappa \nReddy, J. in para 4 of the Report has made the following \nobservations: \n        The principles of statutory construction are well \nsettled.  Words occurring in statutes of liberal import \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 9 \nsuch as social welfare legislation and human rights’ \nlegislation are not to be put in Procrustean beds or shrunk \nto Lilliputian dimensions. In construing these legislations \nthe imposture of literal construction must be avoided and \nthe prodigality of its misapplication must be recognized \nand reduced.  Judges ought to be more concerned with \nthe ’colour’, the ’content’ and the ’context’ of such statutes \n(we have borrowed the words from Lord Wilberforce’s \nopinion in Prenn v. Simmonds).   In the same opinion \nLord Wilberforce pointed out that law is not to be left \nbehind in some island of literal interpretation but is to \nenquire beyond the language, unisolated from the matrix \nof facts in which they are set; the law is not to be \ninterpreted purely on internal linguistic considerations.  \nIn one of the cases cited before us, that is, Surender \nKumar Verma v. Central Govt. Industrial Tribunal-cum-\nLabour Court we had occasion to say:\n        \"Semantic luxuries are misplaced in the \ninterpretation of ’bread and butter’ statutes. Welfare \nstatutes must, of necessity, receive a broad interpretation.  \nWhere legislation is designed to give relief against \ncertain kinds of mischief, the Court is not to make \ninroads by making etymological excursions.\"\n  \n        Francis Bennion in his Statutory Interpretation \nSecond Edn., has dealt with the Functional Construction \nRule in Part XV of his book.  The nature of purposive \nconstruction is dealt with in Part XX at p. 659 thus:\n        \"A purposive construction of an enactment is \none which gives effect to the legislative purpose \nby- \n        (a)     following the literal meaning of the \nenactment where that meaning is in accordance \nwith the legislative purpose (in this Code called a \npurposive-and-literal construction), or \n        (b)     applying a strained meaning where the \nliteral meaning is not in accordance with the \nlegislative purpose (in the Code called a \npurposive and strained construction).\"\nAt p. 661 of the same book, the author has considered the \ntopic of \"Purposive Construction\" in contrast with literal \nconstruction.",

They  were also convicted under Section 148 IPC but no\nseparate sentence  was passed for such offence. All the said\neight accused  were further convicted under Section 436 read\nwith Section  149 IPC  but no  separate sentence was awarded\nfor such  conviction  in  view  of  death  sentence  awarded\nagainst them.\n     The said  convicted accused  filed  two  appeals  being\nCriminal Appeal  No. 460  and 461  of 1992  before the  High\nCourt  of  Patna  impugning  the  order  of  conviction  and\nsentence passed  by the  learned Additional  Sessions Judge,\nAurangabad. The  said appeals  and Death  Reference No. 9 of\n1992 for  confirmation of death sentence awarded against the\nsaid eight  convicted accused  were disposed of by the Patna\nHigh Court  by a  common judgment  dated 7.12.1995. The High\nCourt upheld  the  conviction  of  Jainarayan  Yadav  (A-4),\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 6 \nChintaman Yadav  (A-5) and  Ram Pravesh  Yadav  (A-8)  under\nSection 302  IPC and  also upheld  the conviction of Rajaram\nYadav under Section 302/34 IPC. But the conviction of Keswar\nYadav (A-3), Brahamdeo Yadav (A-6) and Chandradeep Yadav (A-\n7) under  Section 302  IPC was converted to conviction under\nSection 302  read with  Section 34  IPC. The High Court also\nupheld the conviction f the appellants under Section 148 and\n436/149 IPC  and under  Section 302/149  IPC but no separate\nsentence was  passed for  such conviction.  The  High  Court\nupheld the  death sentence  awarded against each of the said\neight convicted accused by accepting the Death Reference.\n     Initially  the   appellants  sent  an  application  for\nspecial leave  from jail  being S.L.P. (Crl.) No.323 of 1996\nand Sri  S. S.  Khanduja, learned advocate, was appointed as\namicus curiae.  Later on,  the appellants  preferred  S.L.P.\n(Crl.) No.  432 of  1996 and S.L.P. (Crl.) No. 3434 of 1996.\nMr. Rajendra Singh, the learned senior advocate, appeared in\nthe appeal  arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) 452 of 1996 and Mr.\nK.G. Kannabniran,  learned senior advocate, appeared for the\nappellants in  the appeal  arising out  of S.L.P. (Crl.) No.\n3434 of  1996. Mr.  Udai Sinha, learned senior advocate, has\nappeared for the State in all the appeals.\n     Mr. Rajendra  Singh has submitted that since  the scope\nof the  appeals is  only limited to the question of sentence\nto be  suffered by  the  appellants,  he  will  confine  his\narguments only  on the  question of  sentence on the footing\nthat the  order of  conviction passed  against the appellant\nstands upheld by this Court. Mr. Singh has submitted that in\nthe instant case, the appellants have been convicted for the\noffence of murdering Gaya Singh; Sita Ram Singh, the wife of\nSita Ram  Singh, Giranti  Kumar, Renu  Kumar; Ritu Kumar and\nGaya Prasad.  The appellants  have also been convicted under\nSection 436 read with Section 148 Indian Penal Code but they\nhave been  acquitted for  the offence under Section 120 B of\nthe IPC.  Mr. Singh  has submitted that 74 persons faced the\ntrial before the Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Trial\nNo. 180 of 1987 (1 of 1988), in connection with the incident\nwhich had  occurred at  about 1  A.M. of  30th May  1987  at\nVillage   Baghora,   Police   Station   Madanpur,   District\nAurangabad. Twenty  six persons  including  6  women  and  9\nchildren were  murdered and  few house  in the  said village\nwere reduced  to ashes.  Out of  26 persons  murdered in the\nsaid incident,  25 belonged  to one community and 20 of them\nalso belonged to the same family. As the charges against the\nremaining accused  excepting  the  eight  convicted  accused\ncould  not  be  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge acquitted the said accused\nbut convicted the 8 appellants for the offence murdering the\naforesaid six persons and also for the offence under Section\n436 read  with Section 149 IPC. Mr. Singh has submitted that\nthe said  incident in  which 26  persons were  murdered  and\nnumber of  houses were  reduced to  ashes by setting them on\nfire was  undoubtedly a very shocking incident and extremely\nismertable.\n     But the  conviction of the appellants has been based on\nthe basis  of eye  witness account  of a  boy aged  about  9\nyears, namely.  PW 3  Shailendra. According  to PW 3, at the\ntime of  incident he  hid himself  near a Kotha and from the\nplace of hiding, he had witnessed the murder of the said six\npersons, namely,  his  father,  mother,  three  sisters  and\nuncle. Mr.  Singh has  submitted that in the case of a child\nwitness, extreme  care and  caution are required to be taken\nbefore  accepting  the  deposition  of  such  child  witness\nbecause it is not unlikely that a child after witnessing the\nmurder of one or two very close relations, is likely to lose\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 6 \nthe normal  frame of  mino and  composure and thereafter may\nnot be in a position to note subsequent events carefully and\ndepose about  the same convincingly. Mr. Singh has submitted\nthat unfortunately  in this  case no  other eye  witness  is\navailable in  support of  the prosecution  case and both the\nlearned Additional  Sessions Judge  and the  High Court have\nrelied on  the testimony  of the  child witness,  PW  3.  He\nfurther submitted  that according  to PW.1,  the said  child\nwitness shortly  after the  incident ran to him and on being\nasked by  him mentioned  the names of Ram Pravesh, Raja Ram,\nChintaman and  Sranmdeo as  the persons who had murdered the\nsaid six persons. PW 3 did not state before PW1 the names of\nKeshav Yadav,  Jag Narain,  Babu Ram and Chandra Deep as the\npersons who  has also  committed  the  murder  of  said  six\npersons. PW  3, however,  deposed before  the Court that all\nthe said  appellants were responsible for murdering the said\nsix persons  and also  indicated the  role played by each of\nthem but in view of his omission to mention the names of the\nsaid four  persons as  the assailants  in the  commission of\nsaid murder,  the said  four accused  deserve  to  be  dealt\nleniently in the matter of awarding capital sentence.\n     Mr. Singh  has also  urged that  none of the appellants\nwas a  hired assassin or professional murderer but they were\nordinary family  members with  no past  criminal history. It\nhas also  transpired from the deposition that the said crime\nwas committed  in order  to avenge  a carnage  involving the\nkith and kin of the appellants. According to the prosecution\ncase there has been a carnage in village Chnechnani near the\nvillage Baghora.  The said incident of carnage in Chnechnani\nhad taken  place only  about a  1 1/2 months earlier. In the\nincident at  Chnechnani, the  Rajputs had  killed the Yadava\nand the  prosecution has  come out  with  a  case  that  the\nincident of  murder concerning  the  present  appeal  was  a\nconsequence of  retaliation by  the Yadavs  by  killing  the\nRajputs. In the aforesaid circumstances, the strong urge for\nrevenge because  of the trauma suffered by the appellants on\naccount of  carnage in the village Chnechnani where the kitn\nand kin  of the appellants were brutally murdered should not\nbe lost  sight of  as on  account of  such carnage  and such\ntrauma, they  had lost  the normal  frame of mind and became\nmad to  avenge such killings. Such fact should also be taker\ninto account  as an  important mitigating factor in awarding\nthe extreme penalty of death.\n     Mr.  Singh   has  also   submitted  that  some  of  the\nappellants are  quite young. They are not hardened criminal.\nThere is  a fair  chance of their being reformed in the jail\nand to  turn out  as a  responsible and useful number of the\nsociety. In  the aforesaid  circumstances,  they  should  be\ngiven a chance to remorse and get reformed after serving the\nterm of imprisonment.\n     Mr. Kannaohiran  has also  made similar submissions and\nhas submitted  that PW  3, the  said child  witness, was not\nexamined immediately  after  the  incident  but  he  made  a\nstatement before  the police  only on  30th May.  It is  not\nunlikely that  in view  of such  delay, he  might  have  got\nconfused and  having heard  the names  of the  accused  from\nothers failed  to give  true account  of the  incident.",

As common question of law and facts arise in this group of\nappeals   and,   as   such,   all   these   appeals,   arise   out   of   the\nimpugned   common   judgment   and   order   passed   by   the   High\nCourt,   are   being   decided   and   disposed   of   together   by   this\ncommon judgment and order.\n3. Feeling   aggrieved   and   dissatisfied   with   the   impugned\ncommon order passed by the High Court of Punjab and Haryana\nat   Chandigarh,   by   which   the   High   Court   has   dismissed   the\nrespective   revision   applications   and   has   confirmed   the   order\npassed by the first appellate court – learned Additional Sessions\nJudge,   Panchkula,   directing   the   appellants   herein   –   original\n1\nappellants – original accused to deposit 25% of the amount of\ncompensation, in view of the provisions of amended Act No. 20 of\n2018  in  Section  148  of   the  Negotiable   Instruments  Act,  1881\n(hereinafter referred to as the ‘N.I. Act’), the original appellants –\noriginal accused have preferred the present appeals.\n4. The facts leading to the present appeals in nutshell are as\nunder:\nThat criminal complaints were filed against the appellants\nherein – original accused for the offence under Section 138 of the\nN.I. Act.   That the said criminal complaints were filed prior to\n2.8.2018. That the learned trial Court vide judgment and order\ndated 30.10.2018 convicted the appellants for the offence under\nSection   138   of   the   N.I.   Act   and   sentenced   them   to   undergo\nimprisonment of two years and to pay cheque amount + 1% as\ninterest and litigation expenses as fine.\n4.1 Feeling   aggrieved   and   dissatisfied   with   the   order   of\nconviction   passed   by   the   learned   trial   Court,   convicting   the\nappellants – original accused for the offence under Section 138 of\nthe N.I. Act and the sentence imposed by the learned trial Court,\nthe appellants – original accused have preferred criminal appeals\nbefore   the   first   appellate   Court   –   learned  Additional   Sessions\n2\nJudge, Panchkula.  In the said appeals, the appellants – original\naccused submitted application/s under Section 389 of   the Cr.\nP.C.   for   suspension   of   sentence   and   releasing   them   on   bail,\npending appeal/s.\n4.2 That considering the provisions of amended Section 148 of\nthe N.I. Act,  which has been amended by Amendment Act No.\n20/2018,   which   came   into   force   w.e.f.   1.9.2018,   the   first\nappellate Court, while suspending the sentence and allowing the\napplication/s   under   Section   389   of   the   Cr.P.C,   directed   the\nappellants to deposit 25% of the amount of compensation/fine\nawarded by the learned trial Court.\n4.3 Feeling aggrieved by the order passed by the learned first\nappellate Court – learned Additional Sessions Judge, Panchkula\ndirecting the appellants – original accused – original appellants to\ndeposit 25% of the amount of compensation/fine awarded by the\nlearned   trial   Court,   pending   appeal   challenging   the   order   of\nconviction and sentence imposed by the learned trial Court, the\nappellants approached the High Court of Punjab and Haryana at\nChandigarh by way of revision application/s.\n4.4 It was the case on behalf of the appellants that Section 148\nof the N.I.  Act,  as amended by Act No.  20/2018, shall  not be\n3\napplicable with respect to criminal proceedings already initiated\nprior to the amendment in Section 148 of the N.I. Act.\n4.5 The High Court by a detailed judgment and order has not\naccepted the aforesaid contention and has dismissed the revision\napplication/s and has confirmed the order passed by the learned\nfirst   appellate   Court   –   learned   Additional   Sessions   Judge,\nPanchkula directing the appellants ­ original appellants­original\naccused to deposit 25% of the amount of compensation awarded\nby the learned trial Court considering Section 148 of the N.I. Act,\nas amended.\n4.6 Feeling   aggrieved   and   dissatisfied   with   the   impugned\ncommon   judgment   and   order   passed   by   the   High   Court   in\ndismissing the revision application/s and confirming the order/s\npassed   by   the   learned   first   appellate   Court   directing   the\nappellants – original appellants – original accused to deposit 25%\nof   the   amount   of   compensation   awarded   by   the   learned   trial\nCourt under Section 148 of the N.I. Act, as amended, the original\nappellants – original accused have preferred the present appeals.\n5. Shri Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Advocate has appeared\non   behalf   of   the   appellants   –   original   appellants   –   original\n4\naccused and Shri Alok Sangwan, learned Advocate has appeared\non behalf of the original complainant.\n5.1 Shri Vijay Hansaria, learned Senior Advocate appearing on\nbehalf  of   the appellants has vehemently submitted that  in the\npresent case, both, the High Court as well as the learned first\nappellate Court have materially erred in directing the appellants\nto deposit 25% of the amount of compensation as per Section 148\nof the N.I. Act, as amended.\n5.2 It is vehemently submitted by the learned Senior Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that in the present case as\nthe criminal proceedings were initiated and the complaints were\nfiled against the accused for the offence under Section 138 of the\nN.I. Act, prior to the amendment Act came into force, Section 148\nof the N.I.Act, as amended shall not be applicable.  \n5.3 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that the legal proceedings,\nwhether civil or criminal, are to be decided on the basis of the law\napplicable   on   the   date   of   the   filing   of   the   suit   or   alleged\ncommission of offence by the trial Court or the appellate Court,\nunless   the   law  is  amended expressly  with   retrospective  effect,\nsubject to the provisions of Article 20(1) of  the Constitution of\n5\nIndia.     In   support   of   his   above   submission,   learned   Senior\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the appellants has heavily relied\nupon   the   decisions   of   this   Court   in   the   case   of  Garikapatti\nVeeraya v. N. Subbiah Choudhury, reported in AIR 1957 SC 540;\nand  Videocon   International   Limited   v.   Securities  and  Exchange\nBoard of India, reported in (2015) 4 SCC 33.\n5.4 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that even otherwise in the\npresent case, the first appellate Court has interpreted the word\n“may” as “shall” in Section 148 of the N.I. Act and proceeded on\nthe basis that it is mandatory for the appellate Court to direct\ndeposit of minimum of 25% of the fine or compensation awarded\nby the trial Court for suspension of sentence.\n5.5 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing   on  behalf   of   the   appellants   that   the   first   appellate\nCourt heavily relied upon the decision of the Punjab and Haryana\nHigh Court in the case of M/s Ginni Garments and another v. M/s\nSethi Garments (CRR No. 9872 of 2018, decided on 04.04.2019),\nin which it was held that the appellate Court continues to have\ndiscretion as to the condition to be imposed or not to be imposed\n6\nfor suspension of sentence and it was further held that however\nin case discretion is exercised to suspend the sentence subject to\npayment of compensation/fine, such order must commensurate\nwith Section 148 of the N.I. Act.  It is submitted, however, in the\npresent case, the appellate Court did not exercise discretion and\nproceeded on the assumption that it is mandatory to deposit 25%\nof   the   fine   or   compensation  as   a   condition   for   suspension  of\nsentence. It is submitted that therefore the High Court ought to\nhave remanded the matter back to the appellate Court to decide\non the question of suspension of sentence as per the decision in\nthe case of M/s Ginni Garments (supra).\n5.6 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that a similar view is taken\nby  the  Bombay High Court   in   the  case  of  Ajay  Vinodchandra\nShah v. The State of Maharashtra (Criminal Writ Petition No. 258\nof 2019).   It is submitted that in the said decision, the Bombay\nHigh Court has also observed and held that as per Section 148 of\nthe N.I. Act as amended, the appellate Court has the discretion to\ndirect deposit the sum pending appeal, but if at all such direction\nis given, that sum shall not be less than 20% of the amount of\nfine or compensation awarded by the trial Court.  It is submitted\n7\nthat in the present case, the appellate Court wrongly presumed\nthat  the requirement under Section 148 of   the  N.I.  Act   is   the\ndeposit of 25% of the fine or compensation.\n5.7 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellants that in the present case the\nlearned trial Court imposed the fine under Section 138 of the N.I.\nAct, equal to the amount of cheque plus 1%.",

A Coal Mining Service Agreement was entered\ninto between the said Parsa Kente Collieries Limited and AEL.\nThat a Coal Mining and Delivery Agreement (hereinafter referred\nto   as   ‘CMDA’)   was   executed   between   the   appellant   and   the\nrespondent on 16.07.2008 for supply of coal.  \n2.1 As per CMDA, the date of commencement of the contract\nwas 25.06.2011.   As per CMDA between the appellant and the\n2\nrespondent,   the   coal   supply  was   to   commence  at   the   earliest\nwithin   42   months,   or   within   48   months   from   the   date   of\nallotment of coal blocks, i.e., by 25.06.2011. CMDA also provided\na clause for extending the date of commencement.  Clause 3.2.1\nof the CMDA provided for scope of work; Clause 4.1.3 and 4.1.4\nprovided   for   responsibility   of   the   respondent   to   inform   the\nappellant as regards the requirement of coal in advance.  Clause\n4.5 provided for commencement of the date; clause 5.1 provided\nfor   contract   of   price;   clause  5.2.2.   provided   for   calculation  of\nbasic price; clause 5.4.3 provided for escalation in price; clause\n7.1 provided for force majeure and clause 7.3 provided for effect\nof force majeure.   There was a delay of 21 months in obtaining\nthe forest clearance and environmental clearance.  The appellant\nstarted   supply   of   coal   to   the   respondent   with   effect   from\n25.3.2013, i.e., after a delay of 21 months.   It appears that the\ndate of commencement was extended by mutual agreement from\n25.6.2011   to   25.3.2013.     However,   certain   disputes   arose\nbetween the parties, more particularly the escalation price, fixed\ncosts, amount lying in Escrow account and cost of construction\nof railway siding.  Therefore, the appellant invoked clause 10.2 of\nthe CMDA and sought arbitration.  A retired Hon’ble Judge of the\n3\nRajasthan High Court was appointed as the sole arbitrator.  The\nappellant submitted the statement of claim and thereafter filed\nanother statement of claim.  \n2.2 Before the learned Arbitrator, the claim was bifurcated into\nfour  heads,  namely,   (1)  Price  Adjustment;   (2)  Fixed  Costs;   (3)\nEscrow Account;  and  (4)  Construction of  Railway Siding.    The\nlearned Arbitrator passed an award dated 27.05.2015 allowing\nthe claims under the heads of  ‘Price Adjustment’,  ‘Fixed Costs’\nand   ‘Escrow  Account’   and   rejected   the   claim  under   the  head\n‘Construction of Railway Siding’.  While allowing the claim under\nthe head ‘Price Adjustment’, the learned Arbitrator held that the\ndate   of   commencement   of   the   first   operating   year   for   the\npurposes of clauses 5.2.2 read with 5.4.3 would be 25.06.2011.\nThe learned Arbitrator further held that thus the Zero year for\nthe purpose of price escalation has to be 2011­2012.  The learned\nArbitrator   accordingly   held   that   because   the   date   of\ncommencement   of   the   agreement   for   the   purpose   of   price\nescalation is 25.06.2011, the appellant shall  be entitled to the\nenhanced amount as applicable in 2013­2014.   Accordingly, the\nlearned Arbitrator held that the appellant is entitled to the coal\n4\nprice   at   Rs.837/­   PMT   in   F.Y.   2013­14   and   thereafter   the\nescalated   price   in   the   subsequent   years   as   per   the   relevant\nclauses of the contract – CMDA.  \n2.3 That while allowing the claim with respect to ‘Fixed Costs’,\nthe learned Arbitrator held that the respondent could not take\nthe required delivery of the coal from the appellant, thus causing\nloss to the appellant. The learned Arbitrator held that therefore\nthe appellant  is entitled to compensation as claimed for Rs.78\ncrores.\n2.4 That   while   allowing   the   claim   with   respect   to   ‘Escrow\nAccount’, the learned Arbitrator held that the undertaking given\nby the appellant was limited to a contingency where on account\nof failure of completion of mine closure activity by the appellant\nled   to   the   forfeiture   of   any   amount   deposited   in   the   escrow\naccount, the respondent would be entitled to recover the same\nfrom the monthly  running bills  of   the  appellant.    The  learned\nArbitrator observed,  however,  as no such occasion has arisen,\nthe question of any deduction on the said count does not arise.\nConsequently, the learned Arbitrator directed the respondent to\n5\nreturn that amount which was lying in the escrow account which\nwas deducted from the monthly running bills of the appellant.\n2.5 As   observed   hereinabove,   the   learned   Arbitrator   rejected\nclaim  no.4,   namely,   under   the  head   ‘Construction   of  Railway\nSiding’.   The award declared by the learned Arbitrator came to be\nconfirmed   by   the   learned   Commercial   Court,   Jaipur   in   an\napplication under section 34 of the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct.\n3. Feeling aggrieved, the respondent preferred an appeal under\nSection 37 of the Arbitration Act before the Commercial Appellate\nCourt/Division Bench of the High Court of Rajasthan at Jaipur.\nBy the impugned judgment and order dated 28.02.2018, the High\nCourt has allowed the said appeal and has set aside the award\npassed   by   the   learned   Arbitrator   and   confirmed   by   the\nCommercial Court, Jaipur.\n4. Feeling   aggrieved   by   the   impugned   judgment   and   order\npassed  by   the  Division  Bench of   the  High Court,   the  original\nclaimant – the appellant has preferred the present appeal.\n5. Shri Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior Advocate has appeared\non   behalf   of   the   appellant   and   Shri   Tushar   Mehta,   learned\n6\nSolicitor   General   of   India   has   appeared   on   behalf   of   the\nrespondent.\n5.1 Shri Ranjit  Kumar,  learned Senior Advocate appearing on\nbehalf   of   the  appellant  has   vehemently  submitted   that   in   the\nfacts and circumstances of the case, the High Court ought not to\nhave interfered with the concurrent findings of the learned sole\nArbitrator and the learned Commercial Court under Section 34 of\nthe  Arbitration  Act  by  giving  an  alternate   construction   to   the\nCMDA.  It is vehemently submitted that by passing the impugned\njudgment   and   order,   the   High   Court   has   exceeded   in   its\njurisdiction in interfering with the award passed by the learned\nArbitrator,   confirmed  by   the   learned  Commercial  Court,  while\nexercising the powers under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.\n5.2 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellant that under Section 37 of the\nArbitration Act, the scope of judicial inquiry is narrow and does\nnot   entail   giving   own   construction   to   the   contract.     It   is\nsubmitted by disturbing the findings, the High Court has gone\nbeyond the limited scope of inquiry contemplated under Section\n37 of the Arbitration Act. \n7\n5.3 It   is   further   submitted   by   the   learned   Senior   Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellant that the Division Bench of\nthe High Court has failed to appreciate that the interpretation\nmade by the learned sole Arbitrator on the clauses of CMDA was\nplausible   construction/interpretation   and   therefore   the   same\ncould not have been substituted by the High Court in exercise of\npowers under Section 37 of the Arbitration Act.\nIn support  of  his  above submissions,  Shri  Ranjit  Kumar,\nlearned Senior Advocate has heavily relied upon the decisions of\nthis Court in the cases of Associate Builders v. Delhi Development\nAuthority, reported in  (2015) 3 SCC 49; Steel Authority of India\nLimited v. Gupta Brother Steel Tubes Limited, reported in (2009)\n10 SCC 63  and the recent decision of this Court in the case of\nSsangyong   Engineering   &   Construction   Co.   Limited   v.   National\nHighways Authority of   India  (NHAI),  rendered on 08.05.2019 in\nCivil Appeal No. 4779 of 2019, reported in 2019 SCC Online SC\n677.\n5.3.1 It is further submitted by the learned Senior Advocate\nappearing on behalf of the appellant that admittedly there was a\ndelay of 21 months in supply of coal, which was due to the force\n8\nmajeure  as there was a delay in obtaining the forest clearance\nand   environmental   clearance.     It   is   submitted   that   the   price\nwhich was agreed by the appellant in the year 2008 to be paid in\nthe year 2011 would never remain the same in the year 2013­14.",

APPELLANT(S)\nVERSUS\nSTATE OF RAJASTHAN …..        RESPONDENT(S)\nJ U D G M E N T\nSANJIV KHANNA, J.\nThe  appellant,  Guman  Singh  impugns  judgment  dated\n10.03.2017 passed by the Division Bench of  the High Court  of\nJudicature for Rajasthan at Jaipur, which confirms his conviction\nunder Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code (“IPC”, for short) for\nmurder of Shiv Charan and under Section 307 read with Section\n34  IPC  for  attempt  to  murder  Babu  Singh.  Appellant  stands\nsentenced under Section 302 IPC to life imprisonment and fine of\nRs. 10,000/- and in default of payment of fine to serve additional\nrigorous  imprisonment  for  one  year  and  for  an  offence  under\nSection 307 IPC to rigorous imprisonment of 10 years with fine of\nRs.  1,000/-  and  in  default  of  payment,  an  additional  rigorous\nimprisonment of one year.  \nCriminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2017 Page 1 \n2. The  conviction  arises  out  of  FIR  No.  464/2009  registered  on\n30.08.2009 at 8.20 p.m. in Police Station Hindaun City, District-\nKarauli, Rajasthan and the consequent charge-sheet filed against\nthe  present  appellant,  i.e.  Guman  Singh,  and  Jagdish  Singh,\nSatvir Singh and Shyam Singh. Jagdish Singh was acquitted by\nthe Additional Sessions Judge, Hindaun City, Karauli,  Rajasthan\nvide  judgment  dated  07.06.2013  and  Shyam Singh  and  Satvir\nSingh have been acquitted in the impugned judgment of the High\nCourt.\n3. The primary  issue/question raised before  us relates to  veracity\nand  truthfulness  of  the  testimonies  of  Tara  Singh  (PW-1)  and\nVarun  Singh  (PW-4),  son  and  nephew  of  the  deceased  Shiv\nCharan. Tara  Singh  (PW-1)  and  Varun  Singh  (PW-4)  have\ndeposed  that  they  along  with  Shivendra  Singh  were  on  a\nmotorcycle  on  their  way  from  Hindaun  to  Village  Banki.  The\ndeceased  Shiv  Charan  and  the  injured  Babu  Singh  were  on\nanother motorcycle a few steps ahead of them. Near Chauve ka\nbandh,  another  motorcycle  with  the  present  appellant  Guman\nSingh and Satvir Singh s/o Ramoli and Shyam Singh s/o Ummed\nSingh, residents of Village Banki, appeared from behind and came\nparallel  to the motorcycle driven by the deceased Shiv Charan.\nOne of the riders from the third motorcycle had then fired a shot\nCriminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2017 Page 2 \nthat  had hit  Babu Singh on his side and back.  The motorcycle\nskidded  and  Shiv  Charan  and  Babu  Singh  fell  down.  Guman\nSingh had then fired at the chest of Shiv Charan.  Satvir Singh\nand Shyam Singh too had fired at Shiv Charan. Guman Singh,\nSatvir Singh and Shyam Singh had also fired shots at Tara Singh\n(PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4) who had managed to escape by\nrunning towards the Hindaun City to save their lives. They had,\nfrom STD booth near Chungi, informed their relatives about the\noccurrence.  On seeing  a  police  vehicle,  they  drove  along  with\npolice to the place of occurrence.\n4. However,  this  version  as  to  their  presence  at  the  place  of\noccurrence and being eye-witnesses to the firing by Guman Singh\nis a suspect and in grave doubt, in view of the testimony of Gulam\nNavi  (PW-7)  the  Investigating  Officer  and  SHO  Police  Station\nHindaun City, who has deposed that on 30.08.2009 at around 5.30\np.m.  information  was  received  from  an  unknown  person  that\nsomeone had been fired upon by another near Chauve ke bandh.\nPW-7 on reaching the spot along with other police officials found\nBabu Singh lying in an injured condition. Shiv Charan had already\ndied.   One  motorcycle  was lying  at  the  spot.  On  directions  of\nGulam Navi (PW-7), the deceased Shiv Charan and Babu Singh\nwere taken to the hospital.  Gulam Navi (PW-7) has not deposed\nCriminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2017 Page 3 \nand accepted presence of  Tara Singh (PW-1) and Varun Singh\n(PW-4) at the spot at 5.30. p.m. on 30.8.2009. As per PW-7, his\nfirst meeting with Tara Singh (PW-1) was at the hospital at around\n8.20 p.m.,  when a written complaint  was given to him by Tara\nSingh (PW-1). Upon receipt of the written complaint, steps were\ntaken for registration of the FIR.  Similarly, Babulal Bhaskar (PW-\n10) Sub-Inspector, has deposed that on 30.08.2009 at 5.30 p.m.\nhe  had left  the  police  station  and  had reached the  hospital  at\naround  5.55  p.m.  Around  8.20  p.m.,  he  had  initiated  the\nproceedings  after  preparing  the  panchnama  etc.  In  his  cross-\nexamination, PW-10 had testified that till  8.20 p.m. none of the\nwitnesses had disclosed and named the attacker(s) and they had\nalso not indicated as to the type of weapon used in the offence. \n5. On  reading  testimonies  of  Gulam  Navi  (PW-7)  and  Babulal\nBhaskar (PW-10), we find that their versions contradict the version\ngiven by Tara Singh (PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4) as to their\npresence at the place of occurrence and their claim that they were\nfollowing the deceased Shiv Charan and the injured Babu Singh\non another motorcycle.  Their presence is highly doubtful and their\neye-witness account apparently conjured, as they were not found\nat the spot when Gulam Navi (PW-7) the SHO and Investigating\nOfficer had recached  Chauve ke bandh at around 5.30 p.m. on\nCriminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2017 Page 4 \n30.08.2009. Gulam Navi (PW-7) in his cross-examination also had\naccepted as correct that the informant Tara Singh (PW-1) was not\npresent at the place of the occurrence till the time Babu Singh was\nsent to hospital. Between 5.30 p.m. to 8.20 p.m., PW-7 was not\ninformed and told as to who had fired upon Shiv Charan. First\nconversation between Tara Singh (PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4)\nand Gulam Navi (PW-7) was in the hospital at about 8.20 p.m.,\nnearly 3 hours after the occurrence, and both had then for the first\ntime projected themselves as eye witnesses. The assertion and\nclaim of Tara Singh (PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4) of being eye-\nwitnesses to the incident was clearly on second thoughts and after\ndue deliberation. \n6. Statements of Tara Singh (PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4), under\nSection 161 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (“the Code”,\nfor short), were recorded by the SHO and the Investigating Officer\nGulam Navi (PW-7) three days after  the date of occurrence on\n03.09.2009.  This  delay  is  substantial  and  assumes  some\nimportance as it  has been alleged that the FIR has been back\ndated  and  was  never  sent  to  the  Magistrate  as  required  vide\nSection 157 of the Code.\nCriminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2017 Page 5 \n7. While the aforesaid contention as recorded in paragraph 6 may\nnot by itself be significant, but testimony of Babu Singh (PW-3) is.\nBabu Singh, it is stated, had returned from Jaipur on 3.09.2009\nand thereupon his statement under Section 161 of the Code was\nrecorded.  Pertinently, Babu Singh (PW-3) in his examination-in-\nchief had turned hostile and did not name the appellant and three\nothers who were charge-sheeted.  Babu Singh’s presence on the\nspot cannot be doubted, as he was the only injured witness. Babu\nSingh (PW-3) did not depose as to the presence of Tara Singh\n(PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4) on another motorcycle or  that\nthey were following them.  He had stated that he was fired from\nbehind and thereafter,  had become unconscious and had fallen\ndown.  On  regaining  consciousness,  he  had  noticed  police\npersonnel and a person holding camera. Thereafter, he was taken\nto the hospital.   He did not know who had fired at  him.  Babu\nSingh (PW-3) was certainly conscious when he was brought to the\nhospital  because  he  had  also  signed  the  Medical  Examination\nReport  /  MLC.   Babu  Singh  (PW-3)  did  not  depose  as  to  the\npresence of the present appellant nor did he identify any of the\nassailants.  \n8. In view of the testimonies of Babu Singh (PW-3) and Gulam Navi\n(PW-7), there is a clear contradiction and direct conflict between\nCriminal Appeal No. 1475 of 2017 Page 6 \nthe  version  given  by  them  and  Tara  Singh  (PW-1)  and  Varun\nSingh (PW-4),  who assert  and  claim their  presence and being\neye-witnesses to  the occurrence.  We would  for  reasons stated\nabove rely on the version given by Babu Singh (PW-3), Gulam\nNavi  (PW-7)  and  Babu  Lal  Bhaskar  (PW-10).  Therefore,\nidentification by Tara Singh (PW-1) and Varun Singh (PW-4) of the\nappellant- Guman Singh as one of the perpetrators who had fired\non Shiv Charan and Babu Singh (PW-3) is unreliable and should\nnot be accepted without substantial corroboration and supporting\nmaterial/evidence  to  establish  involvement  of  the  appellant-\nGuman Singh.   \n9. On the aspect of corroboration, prosecution relies upon the FSL\nreport,  exhibit  P-48,  opining  that  barrel  residue  examination  of\n‘8mm/.315’ country-made pistol (W/1) had revealed that pistol had\nbeen  fired,  but,  definite  time  of  its  last  firing  could  not  be\nascertained.",

Impugned order dated 12th September, 2017 passed by the Division\nBench of the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad dismisses Writ\nPetition  Tax  No.307  of  2017  filed  by  the  appellants,  namely  M/s\nCentury Metal Recycling Pvt. Ltd. and Gauri Shankar Agarwala, inter\nalia,  on  the  grounds  that  the  High  Court  would  not  exercise\nextraordinary  jurisdiction  under  Article  226  of  the  Constitution  of\nIndia as the matter relates to the valuation of imported aluminium\nscrap which could be assailed in a statutory appeal and it would not\nbe appropriate for the writ court to decide whether the appellant had\nor had not agreed to valuation by the customs authorities.\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 33602 of 2017 Page 1 of 30\n3.

Imported  scrap,  it  is\naccepted, falls under different code names as per specifications of\nthe  Institute  of  Recycling  Industry.  The  grievance  raised  by  the\nappellants is that the 2nd respondent i.e. the Principal Commissioner\nof  Customs,  Noida  Customs  Commissionerate  and  its  Officers\nalmost uniformly do not clear the consignments as per the declared\ntransaction value in the bill of entry but insist that the appellants write\na letter agreeing to pay customs duty as per the valuation by the\ncustoms  authorities  and  compel  them  to  forego  their  right  to\nprovisional assessment under Section 18 of the Customs Act, 1962\n(‘the Act’, for short).

At  the  outset,  we would  record  that  the  appellants  had given up\nprayers  (a)  and  (b)  before  the  High  Court  as  is  recorded  in  the\nimpugned  order  and  we  are,  therefore,  primarily  to  confine  our\ndecision to prayer (c) of the Writ Petition which reads as under:\n“In  the  aforesaid  facts  and  circumstances  of  the\npetitioner respectfully prays that this Hon’ble Court may\nbe graciously pleased to:\n(c)  Issue a suitable writ, order or direction in the nature\nof  MANDAMUS  commanding  the  Assessing  Officer\nthat Respondent No.2 and his subordinate officers to\nmake assessment of aluminium scrap being imported\nby  the  petitioner  on  the  basis  of  the  declared\ntransaction  value  in  accordance  with  statutory\nprovisions under Section 14 & 17(1) of  the Customs\nAct,  and  in  case  of  non-acceptance,  to  allow\nProvisional  Assessment  thereof  under  Section  18  of\nthe  Customs  Act  in  accordance  with  Circular  No.38\ndated 22.08.2016 (Annexure-5)”\nWe  would  for  the  reasons  stated  also  examine  validity  of  the\nadjudication order dated 7th April, 2017.\n5. We are not inclined to remit the appellant to an alternative remedy by\nway of statutory appeal under Section 128 of the Act for the reason\nthat  the  impugned  order  dated  7th April,  2017  in  Assessment\nNo.12/AC/CUS/2017 cannot be sustained in view of the decision of\nthis Court in  Commissioner of Central Excise and Service Tax,\nNoida v. M/s Sanjivini Non-Ferrous Trading Pvt. Ltd.1, the latter\nbeing the sister concern of the first appellant in this case. Further,\n1 Civil Appeal Nos. 18300-18305 of 2017 decided on December 10, 2018\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 33602 of 2017 Page 3 of 30\nhaving heard learned counsel for the parties, we would like to clarify\nthe  legal  position  and  therefore  in  the  facts  of  this  case  would\nexercise our discretion to entertain this appeal despite the alternative\nremedy.\n6. We would begin by reproducing Section 14 of the Act and Rules 3\nand 12 of the Customs Valuation (Determination of Value of Imported\nGoods)  Rules,  2007  (‘the  2007  Rules’,  for  short)  which  read  as\nunder:\n“S  ection 14: Valuation of Goods.\n(1)  For the purposes of the Customs Tariff  Act,  1975\n(51 of  1975),  or  any other law for  the time being in\nforce,  the  value  of  the  imported  goods  and  export\ngoods shall  be the transaction value of  such goods,\nthat is to say, the price actually paid or payable for the\ngoods when sold for export to India for delivery at the\ntime and place of importation, or as the case may be,\nfor export from India for delivery at the time and place\nof exportation, where the buyer and seller of the goods\nare not related and price is the sole consideration for\nthe sale subject  to such other conditions as may be\nspecified in the rules made in this behalf:\nProvided  that  such  transaction  value  in  the  case  of\nimported goods shall include, in addition to the price as\naforesaid, any amount paid or payable for costs and\nservices,  including  commissions  and  brokerage,\nengineering,  design work,  royalties  and licence fees,\ncosts  of  transportation  to  the  place  of  importation,\ninsurance, loading, unloading and handling charges to\nthe  extent  and  in  the  manner  specified  in  the  rules\nmade in this behalf: \nProvided further that the rules made in this behalf may\nprovide for, —\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 33602 of 2017 Page 4 of 30\n(i)  the circumstances in which the buyer and the seller\nshall be deemed to be related;\n(ii)  the manner of determination of value in respect of\ngoods  when  there  is  no  sale,  or  the  buyer  and  the\nseller are related, or price is not the sole consideration\nfor the sale or in any other case; \n(iii)   the  manner  of  acceptance or  rejection  of  value\ndeclared by the importer or exporter, as the case may\nbe, where the proper officer has reason to doubt the\ntruth or accuracy of such value, and determination of\nvalue for the purposes of this section:\nProvided also that such price shall be calculated with\nreference to the rate of  exchange as in force on the\ndate on which a bill of entry is presented under section\n46, or a shipping bill of export, as the case may be, is\npresented under section 50.\n(2)  Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section\n(1),  if  the  Board  is  satisfied  that  it  is  necessary  or\nexpedient so to do, it may, by notification in the Official\nGazette,  fix  tariff  values  for  any  class  of  imported\ngoods or export goods, having regard to the trend of\nvalue of such or like goods, and where any such tariff\nvalues  are  fixed,  the  duty  shall  be  chargeable  with\nreference to such tariff value. \nExplanation. —For the purposes of this section—\n(a) “rate of exchange” means the rate of exchange—\n(i) determined by the Board, or\n(ii)  ascertained in such manner as the Board may\ndirect,  for  the  conversion  of  Indian  currency  into\nforeign  currency  or  foreign  currency  into  Indian\ncurrency;\n(b) “foreign currency”  and “Indian currency”  have the\nmeanings respectively assigned to them in clause (m)\nand clause (q) of section 2 of the Foreign Exchange\nManagement Act, 1999 (42 of 1999).\nxx xx xx\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 33602 of 2017 Page 5 of 30\nRULES\nRule 3.

This order decides perceived conflict between sub-paragraph (2)\nto paragraph 3 and paragraph 8 of the Schedule to the Citizenship\n(Registration  of  Citizens  and  Issue  of  National  Identity  Cards)\nRules, 2003 (“the 2003 Rules” for short). We shall also examine\nthe alternative argument and suggestion of the appellants that this\ncourt should by way of a judicial pronouncement and in exercise of\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23127 of 2018 Page 2 of 27\npower under Article 142 of the Constitution of India provide and\ncreate  an  appellate  forum  for  deciding  disputes  regarding  the\ncitizenship status of persons residing in the State of Assam.\n3. Articles 5 to 9 of the Constitution delineate and determine persons\nwho are citizens of India on commencement of the Constitution.\nArticle 10 provides for their continuance as citizens subject to the\nprovisions of any law that may be made by the Parliament.  Article\n11 of the Constitution, expressly confers power on the Parliament\nto  make  laws  with  respect  to  acquisition  and  termination  of\ncitizenship and all matters relating to citizenship.  To achieve and\nwith this objective, the Parliament has enacted the Citizenship Act,\n1955 (“the Citizenship Act” for short) which provides for acquisition\nof citizenship after the commencement of the Constitution by birth,\nregistration, naturalisation and incorporation of territory.\n4. Section  14A  of  the  Citizenship  Act  states  that  the  Central\nGovernment may compulsorily register every citizen of India and\nissue national identity card to him/her.  The Central Government\nmay  maintain  a  National  Register  of  Indian  Citizens  and  can\nestablish  a  National  Registration  Authority  for  this  purpose.\nProcedure to be followed for  compulsory registration of  citizens\nshall be such as may be prescribed.\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23127 of 2018 Page 3 of 27\n5. Section 6A of the Citizenship Act incorporates special provisions\nas to the citizenship of  persons covered by the Assam Accord.\nFor the purpose of the present order, we would like to reproduce\nsub-section (3) to Section 6A of the Citizenship Act which reads as\nunder:\n“6A. Special provisions as to citizenship of persons\ncovered by the Assam Accord. ―\n(3)  Subject  to the provisions of  sub-sections (6)  and\n(7), every person of Indian origin who― \n(a) came to Assam on or after the 1st day of January,\n1966 but before the 25th day of March, 1971 from the\nspecified territory; and \n(b) has, since the date of his entry into Assam, been\nordinarily resident in Assam; and \n(c) has been detected to be a foreigner, \nshall  register  himself  in  accordance  with  the  rules\nmade by the Central Government in this behalf under\nsection 18 with such authority  (hereafter  in  this  sub-\nsection referred to as the registering authority) as may\nbe specified in such rules and if his name is included in\nany  electoral  roll  for  any  Assembly  or  Parliamentary\nconstituency in force on the date of such detection, his\nname shall be deleted therefrom. \nExplanation.―In  the  case  of  every  person  seeking\nregistration under this sub-section, the opinion of  the\nTribunal  constituted  under  the  Foreigners  (Tribunals)\nOrder,  1964  holding  such  person  to  be  a  foreigner,\nshall  be  deemed  to  be  sufficient  proof  of  the\nrequirement under clause (c) of this subsection and if\nany  question  arises  as  to  whether  such  person\ncomplies  with  any other  requirement  under  this  sub-\nsection, the registering authority shall,― \nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23127 of 2018 Page 4 of 27\n(i)   if  such opinion contains a finding with respect  to\nsuch  other    requirement,  decide  the  question  in\nconformity with such finding; \n(ii)  if  such  opinion  does  not  contain  a  finding  with\nrespect to such other requirement, refer the question to\na  Tribunal  constituted  under  the  said  Order  having\njurisdiction  in  accordance  with  such  rules  as  the\nCentral  Government  may  make  in  this  behalf  under\nsection 18 and decide the question in conformity with\nthe opinion received on such reference.”\nSub-Section  (3)  to  Section  6A states  that  subject  to  the\nprovisions of sub-section (6) and (7), all persons who have come\nto Assam on or after the 1st day of January, 1966 but before 25th\nMarch,  1971 from specified territory and from the date of  entry\nhave been ordinary resident of Assam and have been detected to\nbe  foreigners  shall  register  themselves  with  the  Registering\nAuthority  in  accordance  with  Rules  made  by  the  Central\nGovernment.  If name of any such person has been included in the\nelectoral rolls of any Assembly or Parliamentary constituency, the\nsame shall be deleted therefrom.  Explanation to Section 6A (3)\nstates  that  the  opinion  of  the  Tribunal  under  the  Foreigners\n(Tribunal) Order, 1964 (“the 1964 Order” for short) that the person\nwas a foreigner shall be deemed sufficient for the requirement of\nsub-section (3).  The opinion of the Tribunal is also binding with\nrespect to any other requirement of sub-Section (3) to Section 6A\nof the Citizenship Act. The Registering Authority is required to refer\nCivil Appeal arising out of SLP (C) No. 23127 of 2018 Page 5 of 27\nthe matter to the Tribunal constituted under the said Order if the\nearlier  opinion  of  the  Tribunal  on  other  requirements  is  silent.\nThereupon, the question is decided by the Registering Authority in\nconformity with the opinion received from the Tribunal. \n6. Before we advert to the 1964 Order, we would like to refer to Rule\n4A and the Schedule to the 2003 Rules which was inserted by\nG.S.R 803 (E) dated 9th November, 2009, as a special provision\nrelating  to  National  Register  of  Indian  Citizens  in  the  State  of\nAssam.  Rule 4A of the 2003 Rules reads as under:\n“4A. Special  provisions as to National Register of\nIndian Citizens in the State of Assam— (1) Nothing\nin rule 4 shall, on and after the commencement of the\nCitizenship  (Registration  of  Citizenship  and  Issue  of\nNational  Identity  Cards)  Amendment  Rules,  2009,\napply to the State of Assam.",

The enactment provides, among other things, for consequential \nseniority to persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes\n2\n and Scheduled Tribes\n3\n \npromoted under the reservation policy of the State of Karnataka. The law protects \nconsequential seniority from 24 April 1978. \n \n2 The Reservation Act 2018 was preceded in time by the Karnataka \nDetermination of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of \nthe Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act 2002\n4\n. The \nconstitutional validity of the Reservation Act 2002 was challenged in B K Pavitra \nv Union of India\n5\n, (―B K Pavitra I‖). A two judge Bench of this Court (consisting \nof Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel and Justice U U Lalit) held Sections 3 and 4 of the \nReservation Act 2002 to be ultra vires Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution on \nthe ground that an exercise for determining ―inadequacy of representation‖, \n―backwardness‖ and the impact on ―overall efficiency‖ had not preceded the \nenactment of the law. Such an exercise was held to be mandated by the decision \nof a Constitution Bench of this Court in M Nagaraj v Union of India\n6\n (―Nagaraj‖).\n                                                          \n1\n Reservation Act 2018  \n2\n SCs \n3\n STs \n4\n Reservation Act 2002 \n5\n (2017) 4 SCC 620 \n6\n (2006) 8 SCC 212 \nPART B  \n6 \n \n In the absence of the State of Karnataka having collected quantifiable data on \nthe above three parameters, the Reservation Act 2002 was held to be invalid. \n \n3 The legislature in the State of Karnataka enacted the Reservation Act 2018 \nafter this Court invalidated the Reservation Act 2002 in B K Pavitra I. The \ngrievance of the petitioners is that the state legislature has virtually re-enacted \nthe earlier legislation without curing its defects. According to the petitioners, it is \nnot open to a legislative body governed by the parameters of a written \nconstitution to override a judicial decision, without taking away its basis. On the \nother hand, the State government has asserted that an exercise for collecting \n―quantifiable data‖ was in fact carried out, consistent with the parameters required \nby the decision in Nagaraj. The petitioners question both the process and the \noutcome of the exercise carried out by the state for collecting quantifiable data.  \n \nB The constitutional backdrop to reservations in Karnataka  \n4 The present case necessitates that this Court weave through the body of \nprecedent which forms a part of our constitutional jurisprudence on the issue of \nreservations. In many ways, the issues before the Court are unique. For, in the \npost Nagaraj world which governs this body of law, the State government \ndefends its legislation on the ground that it has fulfilled the constitutional \nrequirement of collecting quantifiable data before it enacted the law. If such an \nexercise has been carried out, the Court will need to address itself to the \nstandard of judicial review by a constitutional court of a legislation enacted by a \ncompetent legislature. The extent to which a data collection exercise by the \nPART B  \n7 \n \ngovernment, which precedes the enactment of the law, may be reviewed by the \nCourt is a seminal issue.  B K Pavitra I involved a situation where this Court \ninvalidated a law on the ground that no exercise of data collection was carried out \nby the State of Karnataka. In the present batch of cases, (herein referred to as B \nK Pavitra II), there is a constitutional challenge to the validity of a law enacted \nafter the State had undertaken the exercise of collecting quantifiable data. \nWhether that exercise of data collection and the enactment of the new law which \nhas emerged on its foundation takes away the basis of or the cause for the \ninvalidation of the Reservation Act 2002 in B K Pavitra I is an essential question \nfor our consideration.  \nIn this background, we set out the significant facts, in the chequered history of the \npresent case.  \n \n5 In exercise of the power conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of the \nConstitution, the Governor of Karnataka framed the Karnataka Government \nServant (Seniority Rules) 1957\n7\n. Rules 2 and 4 provide for seniority on the basis \nof the period of service in a given cadre. There was no specific rule governing \nseniority in respect of roster promotions. \nRule 2 inter alia, provides as follows: \n―2. Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained the \nseniority of a person in a particular cadre of service or class \nof post shall be determined as follows:- \n(a) Officers appointed substantively in clear vacancies shall \nbe senior to all persons appointed on officiating or any \nother basis in the same cadre of service or class of post; \n                                                          \n7\n The Rules 1957 \nPART B  \n8 \n \n(b) The seniority inter se of officers who are confirmed shall \nbe determined according to dates of confirmation, but \nwhere the date of confirmation of any two officers is the \nsame, their relative seniority will be determined by their \nseniority inter se while officiating in the same post and if \nnot, by their seniority inter se in the lower grade. \n(c) Seniority inter se of persons appointed on temporary \nbasis will be determined by the dates of their continuous \nofficiation in that grade and where the period of officiation \nis the same the seniority inter se in the lower grade shall \nprevail.‖ \n \nRule 4 provides for the determination of seniority where promotions are made at \nthe same time on the basis of seniority-cum-merit to a class of posts or cadre: \n―4. When promotions to a class of post or cadre are made on \nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit at the same time, the relative \nseniority shall be determined.- \n(i) if promotions are made from any one cadre or class of \npost, by their seniority inter se in the lower cadre or class \nof post; \n(ii) if promotions are made from several cadres or classes of \nposts of the same grade, by the period of service in those \ngrades; \n(iii) if promotions are made from several cadres or classes of \nposts, the grades of which are not the same, by the order \nin which the candidates are arranged by the authority \nmaking the promotion, in consultation with Public Service \nCommission where such consultation is necessary, taking \ninto consideration the order in which promotions are to be \nmade from those several cadres or classes of post.‖ \n \nRule 4-A provides for the determination of the seniority where promotion is made \nby selection: \n―4-A When promotions to a class of post or cadre are \nmade by selection at the same time either from several \ncadres or classes of post or from same cadre or class of post \nby the order in which the candidates are arranged in order of \nmerit by the Appointing Authority making the selection, in \nconsultation with Public Service Commission where such \nconsultation is necessary.",

The enactment provides, among other things, for consequential \nseniority to persons belonging to the Scheduled Castes\n2\n and Scheduled Tribes\n3\n \npromoted under the reservation policy of the State of Karnataka. The law protects \nconsequential seniority from 24 April 1978. \n \n2 The Reservation Act 2018 was preceded in time by the Karnataka \nDetermination of Seniority of the Government Servants Promoted on the Basis of \nthe Reservation (to the Posts in the Civil Services of the State) Act 2002\n4\n. The \nconstitutional validity of the Reservation Act 2002 was challenged in B K Pavitra \nv Union of India\n5\n, (―B K Pavitra I‖). A two judge Bench of this Court (consisting \nof Justice Adarsh Kumar Goel and Justice U U Lalit) held Sections 3 and 4 of the \nReservation Act 2002 to be ultra vires Articles 14 and 16 of the Constitution on \nthe ground that an exercise for determining ―inadequacy of representation‖, \n―backwardness‖ and the impact on ―overall efficiency‖ had not preceded the \nenactment of the law. Such an exercise was held to be mandated by the decision \nof a Constitution Bench of this Court in M Nagaraj v Union of India\n6\n (―Nagaraj‖).\n                                                          \n1\n Reservation Act 2018  \n2\n SCs \n3\n STs \n4\n Reservation Act 2002 \n5\n (2017) 4 SCC 620 \n6\n (2006) 8 SCC 212 \nPART B  \n6 \n \n In the absence of the State of Karnataka having collected quantifiable data on \nthe above three parameters, the Reservation Act 2002 was held to be invalid. \n \n3 The legislature in the State of Karnataka enacted the Reservation Act 2018 \nafter this Court invalidated the Reservation Act 2002 in B K Pavitra I. The \ngrievance of the petitioners is that the state legislature has virtually re-enacted \nthe earlier legislation without curing its defects. According to the petitioners, it is \nnot open to a legislative body governed by the parameters of a written \nconstitution to override a judicial decision, without taking away its basis. On the \nother hand, the State government has asserted that an exercise for collecting \n―quantifiable data‖ was in fact carried out, consistent with the parameters required \nby the decision in Nagaraj. The petitioners question both the process and the \noutcome of the exercise carried out by the state for collecting quantifiable data.  \n \nB The constitutional backdrop to reservations in Karnataka  \n4 The present case necessitates that this Court weave through the body of \nprecedent which forms a part of our constitutional jurisprudence on the issue of \nreservations. In many ways, the issues before the Court are unique. For, in the \npost Nagaraj world which governs this body of law, the State government \ndefends its legislation on the ground that it has fulfilled the constitutional \nrequirement of collecting quantifiable data before it enacted the law. If such an \nexercise has been carried out, the Court will need to address itself to the \nstandard of judicial review by a constitutional court of a legislation enacted by a \ncompetent legislature. The extent to which a data collection exercise by the \nPART B  \n7 \n \ngovernment, which precedes the enactment of the law, may be reviewed by the \nCourt is a seminal issue.  B K Pavitra I involved a situation where this Court \ninvalidated a law on the ground that no exercise of data collection was carried out \nby the State of Karnataka. In the present batch of cases, (herein referred to as B \nK Pavitra II), there is a constitutional challenge to the validity of a law enacted \nafter the State had undertaken the exercise of collecting quantifiable data. \nWhether that exercise of data collection and the enactment of the new law which \nhas emerged on its foundation takes away the basis of or the cause for the \ninvalidation of the Reservation Act 2002 in B K Pavitra I is an essential question \nfor our consideration.  \nIn this background, we set out the significant facts, in the chequered history of the \npresent case.  \n \n5 In exercise of the power conferred by the proviso to Article 309 of the \nConstitution, the Governor of Karnataka framed the Karnataka Government \nServant (Seniority Rules) 1957\n7\n. Rules 2 and 4 provide for seniority on the basis \nof the period of service in a given cadre. There was no specific rule governing \nseniority in respect of roster promotions. \nRule 2 inter alia, provides as follows: \n―2. Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained the \nseniority of a person in a particular cadre of service or class \nof post shall be determined as follows:- \n(a) Officers appointed substantively in clear vacancies shall \nbe senior to all persons appointed on officiating or any \nother basis in the same cadre of service or class of post; \n                                                          \n7\n The Rules 1957 \nPART B  \n8 \n \n(b) The seniority inter se of officers who are confirmed shall \nbe determined according to dates of confirmation, but \nwhere the date of confirmation of any two officers is the \nsame, their relative seniority will be determined by their \nseniority inter se while officiating in the same post and if \nnot, by their seniority inter se in the lower grade. \n(c) Seniority inter se of persons appointed on temporary \nbasis will be determined by the dates of their continuous \nofficiation in that grade and where the period of officiation \nis the same the seniority inter se in the lower grade shall \nprevail.‖ \n \nRule 4 provides for the determination of seniority where promotions are made at \nthe same time on the basis of seniority-cum-merit to a class of posts or cadre: \n―4. When promotions to a class of post or cadre are made on \nthe basis of seniority-cum-merit at the same time, the relative \nseniority shall be determined.- \n(i) if promotions are made from any one cadre or class of \npost, by their seniority inter se in the lower cadre or class \nof post",

This  act  on  the  part  of  the  contemnor\nconstitutes  criminal  contempt  within  the  meaning  of\nSection 2(c) of Contempt of Courts Act, 1971, as this act\nhas not only lowered the authority of the Court but also\nscandalised the Court and the same has also the tendency\nof interference with the due course of administration of\njustice.”  \n3. The reply was filed by the contemnor to the effect that he had filed an\napplication on behalf of Akhilesh Kumar Shukla on 19.10.2012 under section\n156(3)  Cr.P.C.  which was heard by C.J.M.  of  Allahabad on 30.10.2012 and\n8.11.2012 was the date fixed for passing the order. The contemnor alleged that\nbefore pronouncement of the order on 8.11.2012 he saw one of the accused,\nSharad Tandon, General Manager, District Industries Centre, Allahabad, sitting\nin the chamber of the CJM. He apprehended that his client will not get justice,\nhence,  he  moved  an  application  on  8.11.2012  before  the  Chief  Judicial\nMagistrate  not  to  pass  any  order  since  the  contemnor  was  willing  to  file  a\ntransfer application before the District Judge, Allahabad. The CJM assured not\nto pass any order but actually passed an order on the same day by converting\napplication filed under section 156(3) Cr.PC into a complaint case registered as\nCase  No.13500  of  2012.  The  CJM took  away  the  application  from record.\n3\nThereafter, the contemnor moved an application before the District & Sessions\nJudge, Allahabad on 9.11.2012 making a complaint against the CJM, Allahabad.\n4. Another  application  was  filed  by  the  contemnor  on  30.11.2012  under\nsection 156(3) Cr. P.C. by counsel appearing on behalf of Alok Kumar Shukla.\nHe stated to the CJM that he had moved an application before the Sessions\nJudge, Allahabad, hence, CJM should not pass any order. The same should be\nplaced before the Sessions Judge, Allahabad for assigning the same to some\nother court. In January, 2013 the contemnor came to know that the CJM had\npassed an order on 18.12.2012 treating the application registered as Complaint\nCase  No.1919/2013.  Initially,  it  was registered as  Miscellaneous Application\nNo.1747/XII/2012. Non-bailable warrant has been issued in the same. He did\nnot  enter  into  the  chamber  of  the  CJM on  21.12.2012,  neither  abused  nor\nthreatened him to beat. The advocates were on strike on the said date. There was\nno question of entering the chamber of CJM or to use filthy language. \n5. The High Court has found the contemnor along with 2-3 junior advocates\nentered the chamber of the CJM and misbehaved as well as attempted to assault\nhim. No application was filed by him on 8.11.2012 before the CJM not to pass\nany order. It was a concocted story. The Magistrate did not reject the application\noutright  and required the complainant to adduce evidence which course was\navailable to him. The contemnor did not pursue the matter and got the earlier\ncase dismissed as not pressed and filed second application. On this the CJM has\nagain  registered  the  complaint  case.  The  matter  is  pending  in  which  non-\n4\nbailable  warrant  has  been  issued  against  the  accused.  The  allegation  of\nsympathy towards accused by the Magistrate has been found to be unfounded,\nbaseless and figment of imagination of contemnor. The defense taken has not\nbeen substantiated by the contemnor.\n6. The High Court has observed that considering the increasing tendency of\nthe advocates in making scurrilous allegations against the Presiding Officers of\nsubordinate courts has to be curbed. The acts of abusing and misbehaving are on\nincrease.  The  action  of  the  advocate  amounts  to  lowering  the  dignity  and\nmajesty  of  the  court.  A deliberate  attempt  to  scandalise  a  judicial  officer  of\nsubordinate court is bound to shake the confidence of the litigant public in the\nsystem and has to be tackled strictly. Damage is not only to the reputation of the\nJudge but also to the fair name of the judiciary. Judges cannot be tamed by such\ntactics into submission to secure a desired order. The foundation of the system is\nbased on independence and impartiality of the Judges as well as responsibility\nto impart justice. In case their confidence, impartiality and reputation are shaken\nthe same is bound to adversely affect the independence of the judiciary.\n7. In our opinion, an advocate is duty bound to act as per the higher status\nconferred  upon  him  as  an  officer  of  the  court.  He  plays  a  vital  role  in\npreservation of society and justice delivery system. Advocate has no business to\nthreaten a Judge or hurl abuses for judicial order which he has passed. In case of\ncomplaint  of  the Judge,  it  was open to  the advocate  to  approach concerned\nhigher authorities but there is no licence to any member of the Bar to indulge in\n5\nsuch undignified conduct to lower down the dignity of the Court. Such attempts\ndeserve to be nipped at the earliest  as there is no room to such attack by a\nmember of noble profession.\n8. The role of a lawyer is indispensable in the justice delivery system. He\nhas to follow the professional ethics and also to maintain high standards. He has\nto assist the court and also defend the interest of his client. He has to give due\nregard to his opponent and also to his counsel. What may be proper to others in\nthe society, may be improper for him to do as he belongs to an intellectual class\nof the society and as a member of the noble profession, the expectations from\nhim are accordingly higher. Advocates are held in high esteem in the society.\nThe dignity of court is in fact dignity of the system of which an advocate being\nofficer  of  the court.  The act  of  the advocate  in the present  case is  not  only\nimproper but requires gross condemnation. \n9. It has been observed by this Court in the matter of  Mr. ‘G‚‘, A Senior\nAdvocate of the Supreme Court in AIR 1954 SC 557 that an advocate has to\nconduct  himself  in  a  manner  befitting  the  high  and  honourable  profession.\nFollowing observations have been made in para 41 :\n“41. .......\n“with ordinary legal rights, but with the special and rigid rules\nof  professional  conduct  expected  of  and  applied  to  a  specially\npriviledged  class  of  persons  who,  because  of  their  priviledged\nstatus, are subject to certain disabilities which do not attach to other\nmen and which do not attach even to them in a non-professional\ncharacter.  ... He [a legal practitioner} is bound to conduct himself\nin a manner befitting the high and honourable profession to whose\nprivileges he has so long been admitted; and if he departs from the\n6\nhigh standards which that profession has set for itself and demands\nof him in professional matters, he is liable to disciplinary action.”\n10. Similarly in Lalit Mohan Das v. Advocate General, Orissa AIR 1957\nSC  250, this Court observed :\n“A member of the Bar undoubtedly owes a duty to his client\nand must place before the Court all that can faitly and reasonably be\nsubmitted  on  behalf  of  his  client.   He  may  even  submit  that  a\nparticular  order  is  not  correct  and may ask for  a  review of  that\norder.  At the same time, a member of the Bar is an officer of the\nCourt and owes a duty to the Court in which he is appearing.  He\nmust uphold the dignity and decorum of the Court and must not do\nanything  to  bring  the  Court  itself  into  disrepute.   The  appellant\nbefore us grossly overstepped the limits of propriety when he made\nimputations of partiality and unfairness against the Munsif in open\nCourt.  In suggesting that the Munsif followed no principle in his\norders,  the  appellant  was  adding  insult  to  injury,  because\npreliminary point of jurisdiction and Court fees, which order had\nbeen upheld by the High Court in revision.  Scandalising the Court\nin such manner is really polluting the very fount of justice; such\nconduct as the appellant indulged in was not a matter between an\nindividual member of the Bar and a member of the judicial service;\nit brought into disrepute the whole administration of justice. From\nthat  point  of  view,  the  conduct  of  the  appellant  was  highly\nreprehensible.",

Leave granted.\n2. These Criminal Appeals are filed against the impugned judgment\nand   order   of   the   High   Court   of   Punjab   and   Haryana,   dated\n17.11.2017,  passed   in  Criminal  Revision  No.  4070 of  2017  and\nCriminal   Revision   No.   4113   of   2017,   wherein   the   High   Court\n1\ndismissed the Criminal Revision Petitions and upheld the order of\nthe Trial Court summoning the accused­appellants herein, under\nSection 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 [hereinafter\n‘CrPC’ for brevity].\n3. The factual narration of this case  is that on 05.03.2015, a First\nInformation   Report   was   lodged   in   the   Police   Station   Sadar,\nJalalabad against eleven accused for the offence committed under\nSections 21, 24, 25, 27, 28, 29 and 30 of the Narcotic Drugs and\nPsychotropic Substance Act, 1985, Section 25­A of the Arms Act\nand Section 66 of the Information Technology Act, 2000. Initially,\nunder   the  1st  charge  sheet  dated  06.09.2015,   ten  accused  were\nsummoned and put to trial in Sessions Case No. 289 of 2015. Even\nthough a second charge sheet was filed by the police, the same did\nnot name the accused­appellants herein.\n4. Subsequently, on 31.07.2017, the prosecution filed an application\nunder  Section 311 of  CrPC  for  recalling PW­4 and PW­5,  which\ncame to be allowed. On such recall the aforesaid witnesses named\nthe accused­appellants herein. Thereafter, the prosecution filed an\napplication under Section 319 of CrPC in Sessions Case No. 289 of\n2015 for summoning additional five accused (including the present\n2\nappellants herein) by placing reliance on statements of PW­4, PW­5\n(recalled witnesses) and PW­13. \n5. On 31.10.2017, the Sessions Court first pronounced the judgment\nin   Sessions   Case   No.   289   of   2015,   convicting   the   nine   other\naccused put on trial.  On the same day, by a separate order the\nSessions Court, while allowing the application of the prosecution,\nsummoned accused­appellants herein under Section 319 of CrPC.\nAggrieved by the summoning by the Sessions Court, the accused­\nappellants, filed separate Criminal Revision Petitions, in the High\nCourt of Punjab and Haryana, being Criminal Revision Nos. 4070\nand   4113   of   2017.   The   High   Court   by   the   common   impugned\njudgment,   dismissed   the   Criminal   Revision,   and   upheld   the\nsummoning order passed by the Sessions Court. \n6. Aggrieved by the impugned judgment and order of the High Court,\naccused   appellants   have   approached   this   Court   through   these\nSpecial Leave Petitions.\n7. Heard   learned   counsels   appearing   for   both   parties.   Mr.   P.   S.\nPatwalia,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the\naccused­appellant   in  SLP   (Crl)  No.   9063  of   2017  contended  by\nrelying upon the  Hardeep Singh v.  State of  Punjab,  (2014)  3\n3\nSCC 92 to state that, the power under Section 319 (1) CrPC can be\nexercised at any time after the filing of the charge­sheet and before\nthe   pronouncement   of   the   judgment.   In   the   present   case,   the\naforesaid summoning order passed after the order of conviction is\nin clear breach of the principles laid down in the Hardeep Singh\nCase  (supra).  The   counsel   further   contended   that   when   the\nHardeep Singh Case  (supra),  has clearly prescribed the stage at\nwhich   an   application   under   Section   319   Cr.P.C,   can   be\nentertained, the aforesaid violation is not merely procedural but is\nrather a substantial one. Lastly, the counsel contended that the\nmoment   the   trial   is   concluded   and   the   matter   is   reserved   for\njudgment, then the stage for exercising power under Section 319\nCrPC, ends and the court becomes functus officio.\n8. Mr.   V.   Giri,   learned   senior   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   the\naccused­appellant   (in   SLP   (Crl)   No.9150/2017),   while   generally\nsupporting Mr. Patwalia has submitted that the order summoning\nthe appellants herein was passed simultaneous with the order of\nconviction of  other  accused.  The counsel  submitted that  Section\n319 (4) Cr.P.C, has to be read along with Section 319 (1)­ which\nprovides   that   the  new person  has   to  be   tried   together  with   the\n4\naccused. This principle is based on the “commonality of evidences”.\nBut in the present case, allowing such application under Section\n319 Cr.P.C, goes to the root of fair trial, as the court has already\nconsidered such evidence and has proceeded to speak on it. It is\nthe same evidence which would be reappreciated, and the inclusion\nof such evidence vitiates the principles of fair trial.\n9. Mr. Harin P. Raval, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe respondent State in  SLP (Crl.)  No. 9063 of 2017  argued that\neven   if   it   is   assumed   that   the   summoning   order   was   passed\nsubsequent to the conviction order,  the relevant consideration  is\nthat application of mind was within the prescribed time limit under\nSection  319   of   Cr.P.C.   The  process   of   application   of  mind   and\npronouncement  of   summoning  order  are  separate  under  Section\n319,  Cr.P.C,  and   it   is   the   time  of  application  of  mind  which   is\nrelevant. The counsel  further drew our attention to the fact that\nundisputedly,  the  application under  Section 319 CrPC was  filed\nand heard during the pendency of the trial, and the order thereon\nwas   reserved.   In   this   context,   the   counsel   submitted   that,   the\napplication under Section 319, Cr.P.C was separated from the trial\nby   the   direction   of   the  High  Court   so   as   to   complete   the   trial\nexpeditiously   in   a   time   bound   manner.   Now   the   aforesaid   fact\n5\ncannot   be   used   to   prejudice   the   case   of   the   State.   Lastly,   the\ncounsel maintained that the summoning order under Section 319,\nCrPC was passed on the same day, simultaneously, along with the\nfinal judgment convicting the other accused. Therefore, there is no\nprocedural   irregularity  committed.  Moreover,  he emphasized that\nthe trial in this case could not be said to be completed unless a\ndecision   was   given   in   respect   of   all   the   accused   fully.   This\nsubmission was based on the fact that the trial had been bifurcated\nand was pending in respect of the other absconding accused, which\nwould sustain the exercise of power under Section 319.\n10. Mr. Sidharth Luthra, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of\nthe   respondent   State   in  SLP   (Crl.)   No.   9150   of   2017,   while\nsupporting the arguments made by Senior Counsel  Mr. Harin P.\nRaval, further submitted that it is settled law that procedural laws\nmust be liberally construed to render justice. Moreover, assuming\nbut  not   admitting   that   an   irregularity   in   the   exercise   of   power\nunder Section 319 Cr.P.C was committed by the Trial Court, the\nsame would not vitiate the proceedings. The counsel concluded his\narguments by stating that the finding of the trial court cannot be\nreversed under Section 465 CrPC as the appellant has not made\nout a case of failure of justice.\n6\n11. In   light   of   the   facts   and   arguments   presented   before   us,   the\nfollowing questions arise for our consideration: ­\nI. Whether the order of the Sessions Judge summoning\nthe  appellants  herein  as   additional   accused  was   in\nbreach of Section 319, CrPC?\nII. If   the   answer   to   the   above   question   is   in   the\naffirmative, could the order of the courts below still be\nsustained under the Code?\n12.   At   the   outset,   it   is   pertinent   to  note   that   Section   319   Cr.P.C\nreflects two important objectives;  firstly,  the Courts duty to bring\nhome the guilt of all the accused and render complete justice and\nsecondly, the duty of the State to take every criminal prosecution to\nits  logical end. This Court  in a catena of  judgments has defined\nSection   319   CrPC   as   an   enabling   provision,   especially   in   the\ncircumstances where the investigating agency had failed to array\nany person as an accused. This provision empowers the courts for\ncalling such persons to face the trial. The Section stipulates that a\n‘Court’ may summon any additional accused if it appears from the\n‘evidence’, during the course of any inquiry or trial, that such an\nindividual,  not being an accused, has committed any offence  for\nwhich such person could be tried together with the named accused.\nSub­section 4 of Section 319 of CrPC indicates that the proceeding\n7\nwith   respect   to   the   summoned   individual,   as   per   Clause   (1)   of\nSection 319 of CrPC, may be de­novo or joint trial.\n13. The appellants have argued for a comprehensive reading of Section\n319  (1)  CrPC,  wherein  the  aspect  of  application of  mind by   the\njudge as  well  as   the  pronouncement  of   the   final  order  are  both\nbound by the prescribed time limit.",

NATESAN ETC.                                             ...Respondents\n     J U D G M E N T\nR. BANUMATHI, J.\nLeave granted.\n2. These appeals arise out of the judgment dated 16.12.2016\npassed by the High Court of Madras in Writ Appeal No.1434 of\n2016 and batch in and by which the High Court has affirmed the\norder of the learned Single Judge directing reinstatement and the\nback wages at 50%.\n3. Between 1986-89, the respondents were engaged as Store\nWatchman on daily wages under NMR basis temporarily in newly\ncreated  Sectional  stores  in  various  Sub  Divisions  under  the\ncontrol of Rural Water Supply (RWS) Divisions, Nagercoil. In the\nEngagement Order,  it  has been specifically  mentioned that  the\n1\nengagement on daily wage basis will be purely temporary and the\nservices will be terminated when the requirement is over and that\nthey cannot claim any right for any further appointment in TWAD\nBoard.  In  the Engagement  Order  itself,  it  is  clearly  stated that\nengagement  is  purely  temporary  and  their  services  will  be\nterminated when the requirement is over without prior notice. In\nview of the Board decision, all the Sectional stores were closed\nand  the  Divisional  stores  (each  for  one  district)  were  formed.\nConsequent  on formation of  Divisional  stores,  the respondents\nwere terminated from their services in the year 1990 for want of\nvacancies.\n4. The respondents raised an industrial dispute and on failure\nof  the  conciliation  proceedings,  the  same was  referred  to  the\nLabour Court, Madurai. The Labour Court allowed the petitions\nand held that the termination of the services of the respondents is\nnot valid and is not  sustainable. The Labour Court  passed the\naward on 12.04.2000 directing reinstatement of the respondents\ninto service with back wages for the period of non-employment\nand with continuity of service.  Being aggrieved, the appellant-\nBoard filed writ petition in W.P.No.23720 of 2002 challenging the\naward of the Labour Court.\n2\n5. The learned Single Judge found that the workmen have not\nproduced  any  documents  to  show  that  they  have  worked\ncontinuously for 240 days. The learned Single Judge also pointed\nout that the Management also has not produced any documents\nto  show  that  the  respondents-workmen  have  not  worked\ncontinuously  for  240 days.  However,  the learned Single  Judge\naffirmed the award passed by the Labour Court to the extent of\nreinstatement  of  the  workmen.  Insofar  as  the  back  wages are\nconcerned, the learned Single Judge held that since the matter\nhas  been  pending  from  1991,  the  respondents-workmen  are\nentitled to get 50% back wages only.\n6. Being  aggrieved,  the  appellant-Board  has  filed  the  writ\nappeal before the Division Bench which came to be dismissed by\nthe  impugned  judgment.  Being  aggrieved,  the  appellant-Board\nhas preferred the present appeals.\n7. On  10.08.2018,  the  Supreme  Court  granted  stay  of  the\nimpugned judgment on condition that the appellant-Board to pay\na  sum  of  Rs.2,00,000/-  (Rupees  two  lakhs)  to  each  of  the\ncontesting respondents in addition to the amount that has already\nbeen paid to the respondents. Mr. Paramasivam, learned counsel\nappearing on behalf of the appellant-Board has submitted that in\n3\ncompliance of the order dated 10.08.2018, the appellant-Board\nhas  paid  Rs.2,00,000/-  (Rupees  two  lakhs)  to  each  of  the\nrespondents  which  has  been  recorded  (vide order  dated\n14.01.2019).\n8. We  have  heard  Mr.  Paramasivam,  learned  counsel\nappearing on behalf of the appellant-Board as well as Ms. Sanya\nKumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondents-\nworkmen.\n9. In  the  judgment  passed  in  the  writ  petition,  the  learned\nSingle Judge has pointed out that the respondents-workmen have\nnot  produced  any  documents  to  prove  that  they  have  worked\ncontinuously  for  240  days.  For  temporary  worker  like  NMR\nrespondents, it is mandatory to show that they have continuously\nworked for 240 days in a year. This aspect, in our view, ought to\nhave been taken note by the Division Bench before affirming the\norder  of  reinstatement  of  the  respondents.  In  the  impugned\njudgment, the Division Bench has observed that the attendance\nregister, salary certificates and other relevant documents were in\nthe possession of  the appellant-Board and the same were not\nmarked  as  documents.  It  is  to  be  pointed  out  that  the  initial\nburden  is  upon  the  respondents-workmen to  adduce  evidence\n4\nshowing that they have worked continuously for 240 days. Only\nwhen  the  initial  burden  is  discharged  by  the  respondents-\nworkmen, the burden can be shifted upon the appellant-Board.\nBoth the Single Judge as well as the Division Bench were not\nright in placing the burden upon the appellant-Board to prove that\nthe respondents-workmen had not worked continuously for 240\ndays in a year.  However, in the peculiar facts and circumstances\nof  the  case,  we  are  not  inclined  to  go  into  this  question  any\nfurther.  The  reason  being  that  most  of  the  respondents  have\nattained the age of superannuation therefore, there is no question\nof reinstatement. \n10. All  that  we  are  concerned  is  the  payment  of  50% back\nwages  and  also  the  quantum  of  money  payable  in  lieu  of\nreinstatement.  Learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellant-\nBoard has produced a chart as to the 50% back wages payable\nfrom the date of termination upto the order of the Labour Court\ndated 12.04.2000 at the rate of Rs.18/- per day as wages payable\nand also 50% of the back wages payable as per schedule rates\nfrom the date of termination till the date crossing the age limit or\ndeath which reads as under:-\n5\n50% BACK WAGES CALCULATED FROM THE DATE OF TERMINATION TILL THE DATE OF\nCROSSING OF AGE LIMIT OR DEATH\nSl.\nNo\n.\nName Date  of\ntermination\nDate  of\ncrossing\nage  limit\n(or) death\n50%  back\nwages from\nthe  date  of\ntermination\nupto\nLabour\nCourt  order\ndt.12.4.200\n0 at Rs.18/-\nper  day\nwage  paid\nat  the  time\nof\ntermination\n50%  of\nback\nwages\nfrom\n13.04.200\n0  till  the\ndate  of\ncrossing\nthe  age\nlimit  or\ndeath\nTotal\namount\npayable\n50%  back\nwages  as\nper  the\nschedule\nrates  from\nthe  date  of\ntermination\ntill  crossing\nthe  age\nlimit  (or)\ndeath\nAmount\nalready\npaid\nincluding\nRs.2,00,000\n/-  as\nordered  by\nthe Hon’ble\nCourt \n1 2 3 4 5\n[3+4]\n6 7\n1.

These appeals are directed against common judgment and order\ndated 31.10.2017 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Patna in Civil\nWrit Jurisdiction Case No.21199 of 2013 and all connected matters. \n \n3. In  1981,  all  non-Government  Secondary  Schools  were\nnationalized  and  the  management  was  taken  over  by  State  of  Bihar.\nConsequently, all teaching and non-teaching staff were given salaries and\nemoluments  at  the  Government  scales.   With  the  schemes  like  Sarva\nShiksha  Abhiyan,  introduction  of  Article  21A in  the  Constitution  and\ncoming  into  force  of  the  Right  of  Children  to  Free  and  Compulsion\nEducation  Act,  2009 (‘RTE Act’,  for  short),  the  State  was  required  to\nCivil Appeal No…… of  2019 @ SLP(C)No.20 of 2018 etc.                                        \n3                                                              \nState of Bihar and Ors.  vs.  The Bihar Secondary Teachers Struggle Committee, \nMunger & Ors.\ninduct large number of teachers in order to meet the required obligations.\nThese teachers employed at Panchayat, Nagar Panchayat and Municipal\nlevels were not given same salaries and emoluments like the teachers who\nwere paid at the Government scales.  The petitions seeking same salaries\nand emoluments on the principle of “equal pay for equal work” filed by\nthe latter category of teachers, were allowed by the High Court.  The view\ntaken by the High Court is presently under challenge at the instance of the\nState.  \n4. By the Bihar non-Government Secondary Schools (Taking over of\nManagement and Control) Act, 1981 (‘1981 Act’, for short), management\nand control of non-Government Secondary Schools were taken over by\nthe State.  In terms of Section 3, all non-Government Secondary Schools\nother than Minority Secondary Schools based on religion or language and\nCentrally sponsored, autonomous and proprietary schools were taken over\nby the State Government w.e.f. 02.10.1980.  Consequently, every Head\nMaster, Teacher and other employees of such school became employees of\nthe  State  Government,  with  Management  and  Control  of  all  the\nnationalized  schools  vesting  in  the  Director  of  Education  of  State\nGovernment (In charge of Secondary education). Section 10 dealt  with\nestablishment  of  School  Service  Board  which  was  entrusted  with  the\nCivil Appeal No…… of  2019 @ SLP(C)No.20 of 2018 etc.                                        \n4                                                              \nState of Bihar and Ors.  vs.  The Bihar Secondary Teachers Struggle Committee, \nMunger & Ors.\npower of appointment of Teachers, Head Masters in nationalized schools\nand the Board would make recommendations for appointment of teachers\nand  for  appointment  or  promotion  of  Head  Masters  of  nationalized\nsecondary  schools.   The  District  Secondary  Education  Fund  was\nconstituted under Section 11 and the application of the fund under Section\n12 would inter alia be for payment of salaries and allowances of the Head\nMaster, Teachers and other staff of the secondary schools.\n5. Bihar  Nationalized  Secondary  Schools  (Service  Conditions)\nRules, 1983 were framed by the State Government in exercise of powers\nconferred under Sections 9 & 15 of the 1981 Act.  Under these Rules the\nservice conditions were prescribed for Head Master, Teachers of superior\ncategory, teachers of inferior category and teachers of junior category as\nwell as in respect of non-teaching employees such as clerks, peons etc.\nThese  Rules  prescribed  minimum  qualifications  for  each  of  those\ncategories.   The  Rules  also  dealt  with  subjects  such  as  procedure  for\nappointment, permission, and disciplinary action. Rule 6 dealt with cadre\nof teachers and was to the following effect:\n“6.  Cadre of teachers:-\n1. There shall be Dist. Cadre of junior category teachers,\nof  whose  controlling  officer  shall  be  Dist.  Education\nOfficer.\nCivil Appeal No…… of  2019 @ SLP(C)No.20 of 2018 etc.                                        \n5                                                              \nState of Bihar and Ors.  vs.  The Bihar Secondary Teachers Struggle Committee, \nMunger & Ors.\n2. There shall be Commissionaire Cadre of the teachers\nof  inferior  and  superior  category  of  whose  controlling\nofficer shall be Regional Director.\n3. There  shall  be  State  Cadre  of  Headmaster  whose\ncontrolling officer shall be Director.”\n6. By  the  Constitution  (73rd amendment)  Act,  1992  Part  IX\n(containing Articles 243, 243A to 243-O) was inserted in the Constitution.\nArticle  243B  mandates  that  in  every  State  there  shall  be  constituted\nPanchayats at the village, intermediate and district levels in accordance\nwith Part IX of the Constitution Article 243G is to the following effect:-\n“243G  Powers,  authority  and  responsibilities  of\nPanchayats.  –  Subject  to  the  provisions  of  this\nConstitution,  the  Legislature  of  a  State  may,  by  law,\nendow the Panchayats with such powers and authority as\nmay be necessary to enable them to function as institutions\nof self-government and such law may contain provisions\nfor  the  devolution  of  powers  and  responsibilities  upon\nPanchayats  at  the  appropriate  level,  subject  to  such\nconditions as may be specified therein, with respect to – \n(a) the  preparation  of  plans  for  economic  development\nand social justice;\n(b) The  implementation  of  schemes  for  economic\ndevelopment  and  social  justice  as  may  be  entrusted  to\nthem including those in relation to the matters listed in the\nEleventh Schedule.”\nOne of  the matters  listed  in  the  Eleventh  Schedule  under  Serial\nNo.17 is “Education, including primary and secondary schools”.\nCivil Appeal No…… of  2019 @ SLP(C)No.20 of 2018 etc.                                        \n6                                                              \nState of Bihar and Ors.  vs.  The Bihar Secondary Teachers Struggle Committee, \nMunger & Ors.\n7. By  the  Constitution  (74th Amendment  Act,  1992)  Part  IXA\n(containing Articles 243P to 243Z, 243ZA to 243ZG) was inserted in the\nConstitution.

Singh, J.\n        There are 9 appellants in these four appeals which have been \npreferred against a common judgment and order of the High Court \nof Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh dated July 1, 2005 in \nCriminal Appeal Nos. 671-DB/2003; 701-DB/2003 and 696-\nDB/2003.   The appellants had been convicted and sentenced by \nthe learned Additional Sessions Judge, Bathinda by his judgment \nand order dated 5th August 2003 and 7th August, 2003 to undergo \nimprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.3,000/- each, in \ndefault of payment of fine, to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 6 \nmonths under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC.  They had \nalso been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for 10 years \nand to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/- each, in default of payment of fine, \nto undergo rigorous imprisonment for 2 months under Section 364 \nread with Section 149 IPC and Section 436 read with Section 149 \nIPC.   They had also been sentenced to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for 1 year and 6 months each respectively under \nSection 148 and Section 427 read with Section 149 IPC.  All the \nsentences had been directed to run concurrently. The High Court \nby its impugned judgment and order dated 1st July, 2005 dismissed \nthe appeals preferred by the appellants against the judgment and \norder of the Additional Sessions Judge, Bathinda dated 5th August, \n2003 and 7th August, 2003.\n        The facts of this case disclose that in village Kamalu there \nwere two groups inimically disposed towards each other which \nresulted in several murders.  The appellants herein belong to one \ngroup while the family members of the informant and others \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 8 \nbelong to the rival group.  The case of the prosecution is that on \n19th November, 1989 the informant Chhoto, PW-1, alongwith her \nbrother Shivraj Singh and her sister-in-law (brother’s wife) Balbir \nKaur, PW-2 went to their fields in Village Bangi Kalan where they \nhad also constructed a farm house.  While they were there, the \nappellants came on a jeep and a tractor variously armed with \ndeadly weapons including a double barrel gun.  They also belong \nto village Kamalu, the village of the informant.  Seeing them, the \ninformant’s brother Shivraj Singh hid himself in a room meant for \nstoring chaff but the accused set the room on fire so that he was \ncompelled to come out.   He was immediately abducted by the \nappellants. The informant apprehended that they may kill Shivraj \nSingh.  It is an undisputed fact that thereafter no one has seen \nShivraj Singh alive, nor was his body recovered.  The prosecution, \ntherefore, proceeded on the basis that the appellants abducted \nShivraj Singh and thereafter killed him.  \n        The case of the informant PW-1 is that soon after the \noccurrence she returned to her village and immediately reported \nthe matter to Namberdar Gurnam Singh and Chokidar Tohla Singh \n(both not examined).  Along with them she went to P.S. Raman but \ndespite their insistence the police did not take any interest in the \nmatter and did not record the information she wanted to give.  \nThey, therefore, came back to the village.  The informant admitted \nin her deposition that except the Namberdar and the Chowkidar she \ndid not report the matter to any other person in the village on that \nday.  She, in particular, named Major Singh Thanedar, PW-6, and \nstated that she had met him in P.S. Raman but he refused to take \ndown the information which she wanted to lodge.  \nThree days later, on the 22nd November, 1989 Chhoto, PW-1 \nclaims to have sent a telegram Ext. PA to the President of India in \nwhich she narrated the facts and named the appellants as the \nperpetrators of the offence.  She also stated that Raman police was \nin league with the accused who are powerful Akalis and, therefore, \nthe police refused to take any action by registering the case.  PW-1 \nstated that since police took no action she waited for 2-3 days. \nThereafter she went to Bathinda and sent the abovesaid telegram to \nthe President of India praying for appropriate action in the matter.   \n \n        Thereafter on 4th December, 1989, PW-1, made a written \ncomplaint to the Senior Superintendent of Police (SSP), Bathinda \nin which she narrated the incident which took place on 19th \nNovember, 1989 and complained that police were not taking any \naction and even refused to record the information which she sought \nto give to the police for taking appropriate action.  In the said \ncomplaint to the SSP it was also stated that the appellants with \ntheir other companions had taken away 14 killas of cotton and \nplucked kinnus from two killas.  They had also taken away girders, \ncement and fertilizers etc. lying in the fields.  A complaint had \nbeen lodged by her with the police, but no action was taken.  The \nsaid complaint made by PW-1 was sent to Raman Police Station \nwhere a case was registered against the appellants.  The \nendorsement shows that the case was registered on 4th December, \n1989 by Major Singh, PW-6, who at the relevant time was the \nStation House Officer of P.S. Raman.\n        The case was investigated by the police and charge sheet \nwas submitted against 10 persons which included 5 of the \nappellants before us.  It appears from the record that the statements \nof Amar Singh and Gurdev Singh were recorded by the police in \nthe course of investigation under Section 161 of the Code of \nCriminal Procedure on 9th October, 1990 and on the basis of their \nstatements 5 other persons, namely Gurjit Singh, Harjinder Singh, \nJit Singh, Kuljit Singh and Ajaib Singh were arrayed as accused in \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 8 \nthe case alongwith 5 of the appellants, namely \\026 Sewa Singh, \nSarabjit Singh @ Ujagar Singh @ Jagger Singh, Jagdeep Singh, \nHardeep Singh, and Avatar Singh @ Tari.\nThe trial court, however acquitted five persons who were \nsent up as accused and tried by the Sessions Judge on the basis of \nthe statements of Amar Singh and Gurdev Singh.  Amar Singh and \nGurdev Singh were not even examined as witnesses at the trial.  \nThe remaining two eye witnesses, namely \\026 PW1 and PW-2 did \nnot implicate them. \n        However, four of the accused persons named in the first \ninformation report against whom charge sheet was not submitted \nwere summoned for trial by the learned Additions Sessions Judge \nunder Section 319 of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  They \nwere appellants Sandhura Singh, Sukhmander Singh @ Mander \nSingh, Gurdeep Singh and Rajinder Singh.\n        The informant Chhoto was examined as PW-1 and her \nbrother’s wife Balbir Kaur was examined as PW-2.  Major Singh, \nSHO Raman Police Station was examined as PW-6.\n        The appellants in their statements recorded under Section \n313 of the Code of Criminal Procedure denied their guilt and it \nappears to be their case from the suggestions made to the witnesses \nthat the alleged deceased Shivraj Singh was mentally handicapped \nand that he may have gone somewhere which was not within their \nknowledge.  Their specific plea was that taking advantage of the \ndisappearance of Shivraj Singh they have been falsely involved in \nthis case on account of serious enmity between the two groups in \nthe village.\n        The statement of Sewa Singh was to the effect that he had \ncontested elections to the post of Sarpanch against Jugraj Singh \nbrother of the informant PW-1.  Once he had won and on the \nsecond occasion he lost the election.  This generated some amount \nof bitterness and political rivalry between the two groups.  He \nfurther stated that two sons of appellant Jagdeep Singh had been \nmurdered.  Jugraj Singh, brother of informant, PW-1, and others \nwere tried for the murder of the two sons of Jagdeep Singh in \nwhich his son Jaggar Singh @ Sarabjit Singh appeared as a \nwitness.  He further stated that Niranjan Singh, a brother of the \ninformant, PW-1 had lodged a first information report against him \nand Jagdeep Singh under Sections 447/427/148/149 IPC.  \nHowever, in that case they were acquitted. He also stated that he \nhad been illegally detained in this case and was ultimately released \nby the warrant officer appointed by the High Court. He further \nstated that Niranjan Singh made a complaint against him which \nwas found to be false and was consequently filed but thereafter \naction under Section 182 IPC was initiated against him.  \nSarabjit Singh son of Sewa Singh also made a similar \nstatement.\nAppellant Jagdeep Singh stated that one Mohinder Singh of \nhis village was murdered.  In that case he as well as his father Kaur \nSingh and the father of Mander Singh, namely Chhote Singh were \nalso injured.  In that case he had lodged a first information report \nunder Sections 302/307/324/148/149 IPC and Sections 25/27 of the \nArms Act.",

No.3502 of 2019)\nJitender Kumar @ Jitender Singh  ….Appellant(s)\nVERSUS\nThe State of Bihar       ….Respondent(s)\n                 \nJ U D G M E N T\nAbhay Manohar Sapre, J.\n1. Leave granted.\n2. This   appeal   is   directed   against   the   final\njudgment   and  order  dated  28.03.2019  passed  by\nthe High Court of Judicature at Patna in Criminal\nMiscellaneous No.5293 of  2019 whereby the  High\n1 1\nCourt dismissed the petition filed by the appellant\nherein.\n3. A  few facts need mention hereinbelow for the\ndisposal of this appeal, which involves a short point.\n4. By   impugned   order,   the   High   Court   (Single\nJudge) dismissed the petition filed by the appellant\nherein under Section 482 of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure,   1973   (for   short,   “Cr.P.C.)   and,   in\nconsequence, affirmed the order dated 09.04.2015\npassed by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Jamui in\nconnection with P.S. Case No.154 of 2013 whereby\nthe appellant along  was summoned to face  Session\nTrial No.280 of 2016 pending in the Court of First\nAdditional & Sessions Judge, Jamui for the offences\npunishable under Sections 302, 325, 326, 331, 352\nread with Section 34 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860\n(for short, “IPC”).\n2 2\n5. The   short   question,   which   arises   for\nconsideration  in   this  appeal,   is  whether   the  High\nCourt   was   right   in   dismissing   the   appellant's\npetition.\n6. Heard   Ms.   Anjana   Prakash,   learned   senior\ncounsel for the appellant and Ms. Hemlata Ranga,\nlearned counsel for the respondent­State.\n7. Having   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the\nparties and on perusal of the record of the case, we\nare   inclined   to   allow   this   appeal,   set   aside   the\nimpugned order and remand the case to the High\nCourt   (Single   Judge)   for   deciding   the   appellant's\npetition afresh on merits in accordance with law.\n8. The need to remand the case to the High Court\nhas occasioned because on perusal of the impugned\norder, we find that paras 1 to 4 contain facts of the\ncase, paras 5  and 6 contain the submissions of the\nlearned counsel for the parties, paras 7 to 9 refer to\n3 3\nwhat transpired in the Trial Court, paras 10 and 11\ncontain quotation from two decisions of this Court\nand para 12 contains the conclusion, which reads\nas under:\n“12.  After   giving   analytical   thought   to   the\nfacts   and   circumstances   of   the   case,   the\ninstant   petition   is   found   devoid   of   merit,\nconsequent thereupon is dismissed.” \n9. In the entire impugned order, which consists\nof  13 paras,  we  find that  the High Court  did not\nassign any reason as to why the petition is liable to\nbe dismissed. In other words, neither there is any\ndiscussion   and   nor   the   reasoning   on   the\nsubmissions urged by the learned counsel  for the\nparties. \n10. In our view, such approach of the High Court\nwhile   disposing   of   the   petition   cannot   be\ncountenanced.   Time   and   again,   this   Court   has\nemphasized   the   necessity   of   giving   reasons   in\n4 4\nsupport of the conclusion because it is the reason,\nwhich   indicates   the   application   of   mind.   It   is,\ntherefore,   obligatory   for   the   Court   to   assign   the\nreasons as to why the petition is allowed or rejected,\nas the case may be.\n11. As mentioned above, para 12 only records the\nconclusion.   It   is   for   this   reason,  we   feel   that   the\nmatter must go back to the High Court for deciding\nthe   petition   afresh   on  merits   in   accordance   with\nlaw.\n12. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal\nsucceeds and is accordingly allowed. The impugned\norder is set aside.   The matter is remanded to the\nHigh Court for deciding the petition, out of which\nthis appeal arises, afresh on merits in accordance\nwith   law   keeping   in   view   the   observations   made\nabove.\n5 5\n13. We, however, make it clear that we have not\nexpressed any opinion on the merits of the issues\narising   in   the   case   having   formed   an   opinion   to\nremand the case to the High Court for deciding it\nafresh on the ground mentioned above.  The High\nCourt will, therefore, decide the matter on its merits\nuninfluenced by any of  our observations made  in\nthis order.\n14. The parties are granted liberty to mention the\nmatter in the High Court for its early hearing.\n            ………...................................J.\n  [ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE]\n           \n                         \n....……..................................J.\n        [DINESH MAHESHWARI]\nNew Delhi;\nMay 10, 2019.\n6 6\n",

These appeals\narise out  of three  special leave  petitions filed by eight\nconvicted accused  each  of  whom  has  been  awarded  death\nsentence. In  the Special Leave Petitions, notice was issued\nlimited only  to the  question of sentence to be suffered by\nthe said  eight convicted  appellants namely  (1)  Raja  Ram\nYadav son of Chintaman Yadav (2) Babu Ram Yadav son of Jathu\nYadav (3)  Keswar Yadav alias Ram Keswar Yadav son of Narain\nYadav (4)  Jag Narain Yadav son of Jattu Yadav (5) Chintaman\nYadav son  of Vilas  Yadav (6) Branamded Yadav son of Moheri\nYadav (7)  Chander Deep  Yadav son of Jattu Yadav and (8)Ram\nPravesh Yadav son of Narain Yadav.\n     The   learned   fourth   Additional   Sessions   Judge.\nAurangabad  by   his  judgment   dated  September  30,  1992\nconvicted Ram  Pravesh Yadav, Keswar Yadav, Jag Narain Yadav\nChandradeep Yadav,  Chintaman Yadav  and Brahamdeo Yadav for\nthe offence  of murder  and awarded  death sentence  against\nthem. They  were also convicted under Section 148 IPC but no\nseparate sentence  was passed for such offence. All the said\neight accused  were further convicted under Section 436 read\nwith Section  149 IPC  but no  separate sentence was awarded\nfor such  conviction  in  view  of  death  sentence  awarded\nagainst them.\n     The said  convicted accused  filed  two  appeals  being\nCriminal Appeal  No. 460  and 461  of 1992  before the  High\nCourt  of  Patna  impugning  the  order  of  conviction  and\nsentence passed  by the  learned Additional  Sessions Judge,\nAurangabad. The  said appeals  and Death  Reference No. 9 of\n1992 for  confirmation of death sentence awarded against the\nsaid eight  convicted accused  were disposed of by the Patna\nHigh Court  by a  common judgment  dated 7.12.1995. The High\nCourt upheld  the  conviction  of  Jainarayan  Yadav  (A-4),\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 6 \nChintaman Yadav  (A-5) and  Ram Pravesh  Yadav  (A-8)  under\nSection 302  IPC and  also upheld  the conviction of Rajaram\nYadav under Section 302/34 IPC. But the conviction of Keswar\nYadav (A-3), Brahamdeo Yadav (A-6) and Chandradeep Yadav (A-\n7) under  Section 302  IPC was converted to conviction under\nSection 302  read with  Section 34  IPC. The High Court also\nupheld the conviction f the appellants under Section 148 and\n436/149 IPC  and under  Section 302/149  IPC but no separate\nsentence was  passed for  such conviction.  The  High  Court\nupheld the  death sentence  awarded against each of the said\neight convicted accused by accepting the Death Reference.\n     Initially  the   appellants  sent  an  application  for\nspecial leave  from jail  being S.L.P. (Crl.) No.323 of 1996\nand Sri  S. S.  Khanduja, learned advocate, was appointed as\namicus curiae.  Later on,  the appellants  preferred  S.L.P.\n(Crl.) No.  432 of  1996 and S.L.P. (Crl.) No. 3434 of 1996.\nMr. Rajendra Singh, the learned senior advocate, appeared in\nthe appeal  arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) 452 of 1996 and Mr.\nK.G. Kannabniran,  learned senior advocate, appeared for the\nappellants in  the appeal  arising out  of S.L.P. (Crl.) No.\n3434 of  1996. Mr.  Udai Sinha, learned senior advocate, has\nappeared for the State in all the appeals.\n     Mr. Rajendra  Singh has submitted that since  the scope\nof the  appeals is  only limited to the question of sentence\nto be  suffered by  the  appellants,  he  will  confine  his\narguments only  on the  question of  sentence on the footing\nthat the  order of  conviction passed  against the appellant\nstands upheld by this Court. Mr. Singh has submitted that in\nthe instant case, the appellants have been convicted for the\noffence of murdering Gaya Singh; Sita Ram Singh, the wife of\nSita Ram  Singh, Giranti  Kumar, Renu  Kumar; Ritu Kumar and\nGaya Prasad.  The appellants  have also been convicted under\nSection 436 read with Section 148 Indian Penal Code but they\nhave been  acquitted for  the offence under Section 120 B of\nthe IPC.  Mr. Singh  has submitted that 74 persons faced the\ntrial before the Additional Sessions Judge in Sessions Trial\nNo. 180 of 1987 (1 of 1988), in connection with the incident\nwhich had  occurred at  about 1  A.M. of  30th May  1987  at\nVillage   Baghora,   Police   Station   Madanpur,   District\nAurangabad. Twenty  six persons  including  6  women  and  9\nchildren were  murdered and  few house  in the  said village\nwere reduced  to ashes.  Out of  26 persons  murdered in the\nsaid incident,  25 belonged  to one community and 20 of them\nalso belonged to the same family. As the charges against the\nremaining accused  excepting  the  eight  convicted  accused\ncould  not  be  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt,  the\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge acquitted the said accused\nbut convicted the 8 appellants for the offence murdering the\naforesaid six persons and also for the offence under Section\n436 read  with Section 149 IPC. Mr. Singh has submitted that\nthe said  incident in  which 26  persons were  murdered  and\nnumber of  houses were  reduced to  ashes by setting them on\nfire was  undoubtedly a very shocking incident and extremely\nismertable.\n     But the  conviction of the appellants has been based on\nthe basis  of eye  witness account  of a  boy aged  about  9\nyears, namely.  PW 3  Shailendra. According  to PW 3, at the\ntime of  incident he  hid himself  near a Kotha and from the\nplace of hiding, he had witnessed the murder of the said six\npersons, namely,  his  father,  mother,  three  sisters  and\nuncle. Mr.  Singh has  submitted that in the case of a child\nwitness, extreme  care and  caution are required to be taken\nbefore  accepting  the  deposition  of  such  child  witness\nbecause it is not unlikely that a child after witnessing the\nmurder of one or two very close relations, is likely to lose\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 6 \nthe normal  frame of  mino and  composure and thereafter may\nnot be in a position to note subsequent events carefully and\ndepose about  the same convincingly. Mr. Singh has submitted\nthat unfortunately  in this  case no  other eye  witness  is\navailable in  support of  the prosecution  case and both the\nlearned Additional  Sessions Judge  and the  High Court have\nrelied on  the testimony  of the  child witness,  PW  3.  He\nfurther submitted  that according  to PW.1,  the said  child\nwitness shortly  after the  incident ran to him and on being\nasked by  him mentioned  the names of Ram Pravesh, Raja Ram,\nChintaman and  Sranmdeo as  the persons who had murdered the\nsaid six persons. PW 3 did not state before PW1 the names of\nKeshav Yadav,  Jag Narain,  Babu Ram and Chandra Deep as the\npersons who  has also  committed  the  murder  of  said  six\npersons. PW  3, however,  deposed before  the Court that all\nthe said  appellants were responsible for murdering the said\nsix persons  and also  indicated the  role played by each of\nthem but in view of his omission to mention the names of the\nsaid four  persons as  the assailants  in the  commission of\nsaid murder,  the said  four accused  deserve  to  be  dealt\nleniently in the matter of awarding capital sentence.\n     Mr. Singh  has also  urged that  none of the appellants\nwas a  hired assassin or professional murderer but they were\nordinary family  members with  no past  criminal history. It\nhas also  transpired from the deposition that the said crime\nwas committed  in order  to avenge  a carnage  involving the\nkith and kin of the appellants. According to the prosecution\ncase there has been a carnage in village Chnechnani near the\nvillage Baghora.  The said incident of carnage in Chnechnani\nhad taken  place only  about a  1 1/2 months earlier. In the\nincident at  Chnechnani, the  Rajputs had  killed the Yadava\nand the  prosecution has  come out  with  a  case  that  the\nincident of  murder concerning  the  present  appeal  was  a\nconsequence of  retaliation by  the Yadavs  by  killing  the\nRajputs. In the aforesaid circumstances, the strong urge for\nrevenge because  of the trauma suffered by the appellants on\naccount of  carnage in the village Chnechnani where the kitn\nand kin  of the appellants were brutally murdered should not\nbe lost  sight of  as on  account of  such carnage  and such\ntrauma, they  had lost  the normal  frame of mind and became\nmad to  avenge such killings. Such fact should also be taker\ninto account  as an  important mitigating factor in awarding\nthe extreme penalty of death.\n     Mr.  Singh   has  also   submitted  that  some  of  the\nappellants are  quite young.",

Challenge in this appeal is to the judgment of a Division Bench of\nthe Allahabad High Court by which two Criminal appeals filed by accused\nSattan, Uppendra, Hari Pal son of Kiran Singh and Hari Pal son of Ram\nCharan (Criminal Appeal No. 2140 of 1999) and Criminal Appeal No. 2237\nof  1999  filed  by  accused  Kripal,  Brij  Pal,  Ram  Pal  and  Devendra.  A\nreference under Section 366 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in\nshort  the  ‘Code’)  for  confirmation  of  death  sentence  in  respect  of  the\naccused appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 2140 of 1999 before the High\nCourt was made.  So far as Sattan, Upendra, Hari Pal son of Kiran Singh\nand Hari pal son of Ram Charan are concerned they were sentenced to two\nyears R.I. each under Section 148 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (in short\nthe ‘IPC’), 10 years R.I. under Section 307 read with Section 149 IPC and\ndeath sentence in respect of offence punishable under Section 302 read with\nSection 149 IPC.  The appellants in the Criminal Appeal No.2237 of 1999\nwere convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment under Section 120 B IPC\nalongwith  appellants  in  Criminal  Appeal  No.  2140  of  1999  accused\nMukesh, Dhirendra, Rakesh, Naresh and Pappu also faced trial. Out of them\nPappu and Naresh died during the pendency of trial while Mukesh, Rakesh\nand  Dhirendra  absconded  and  trial  so  far  as  they  are  concerned  were\nseparated.  One  Rajveer  was  also  charged  in  terms  of  Section  120B\nalongwith appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 2237 of 1999. The Criminal\nAppeal  No.2237  of  1999  was  allowed  and  conviction  of\nBrijpal,  Ram Pal and Devendra was set aside. So far as Criminal Appeal\nNo.2140 of 1999 is concerned the conviction as recorded was maintained.\nDeath sentence imposed was altered to life sentence.  In the present appeals\n2\nState  has  questioned  alteration  of  the  death  sentence  to  life  sentence  in\nrespect of appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 2140 of 1999 and the acquittal\nas  recorded in  Criminal  Appeal  No. 2237 of  1999 as  maintained;  While\nupholding the conviction of accused Sattan and Upendra directed acquittal\nof Hari Pal son of Kiran Singh and Hari Pal son of Ram Charan.\n2. According  to  learned  counsel  for  the  State  the  only  appropriate\nsentence in a case of  this nature was death sentence and the High Court\nerred in altering it to life sentence after upholding the conviction. Similarly,\nin respect of the acquittal in the case of the appellants in separate Criminal\nAppeal Nos.2237 and 2140 of 1999 is concerned, it  is submitted that the\nHigh  Court  has  not  indicated  any  reasons  as  to  why  the  conviction  as\nrecorded  by  the  Trial  Court  suffered  from  any  infirmity  to  warrant\ninterference. \n3. Mr.  M. Karpaga Vinayagam, learned Amicus Curiae supported the\njudgments of the High Court.\n4. The prosecution version as unfolded during trial is as follows:\n3\nIn the  night  between  August  30  and 31,  1994 at  about  12.30  five\npersons  of  Sheo Pal’s  family were  gunned down in  his  house  in  village\nSaloni  within  the  area  of  police  station  Bahadurgarh,  Ghaziabad.   Four\nothers were injured, out of whom Neetu also succumbed to his injuries later\non.  This massacre was reported at the police station on the same night at\n2.55 A.M. by one of the survivors,  Smt. Bala, PW 1 widow of deceased\nShiv Singh.  With the registration of case police came into action and the\nInvestigating  Officer  promptly  rushed  to  the  place  of  occurrence  and\nrecorded the statements of Smt. Bala, Neetu and Km. Guddi who all  had\nreceived injuries in the course of ghastly incident. Inquest proceedings were\nheld in respect of dead bodies of five persons, namely, Sheo Pal Singh, Smt.\nKunti Devi, Shiv Singh, Manjeet and Khushal who were reported to have\nbeen shot dead by the assailants while asleep inside their house. Their dead\nbodies  were  sent  for  postmortem examination.  The  investigating  Officer\nShri  Ram Babu  Tiwari,  P.W.9  also  pr-epared  site  plan,  Ex.Ka  48  after\nmaking spot inspection of the place of occurrence. Injured Neetu was sent\nfor medical examination. Under the order of the Investigating Officer S.I.\nShri D.K. Sharma collected samples of blood through memo Ex. Ka 26 from\nnear  the  dead  body  of  Kunti  Devi.  Similarly,  samples  of  blood  were\ncollected  from near  the  dead  bodies  of  other  deceased  persons  through\n4\nmemos Ex. Ka. 27 to Ex. Ka.3. The bed sheet lying on the cot of deceased\nShiv Singh was also taken into possession through memo Ex. Ka. 3. The\nelectric bulbs which are alleged to be giving light at the time of incident\nwere  also  inspected  and  Memo  Ex.  Ka.  32was  prepared.  The  Kurta  of\nInjured Guddi which was stained with blood and had pellet marks was taken\ninto  possession  through  memo Ex.  Ka.33.  The  pieces  of  blood  stained\nbandh  of  cot  of  deceased  Manjeet  and  Khushal  were  also  taken  into\npossession through memo Ex. Ka. 34. The Investigating Officer also found\nempty cartridges, bullet and wads at the scene of occurrence. They were also\ntaken into police custody through EX. Ka.35. He also interrogated Madhu\nand Rikku and other villagers. A raid was made on the house of accused\nMukesh, Sattan and Guddu but they were not found. During investigation\ncomplicity of other accused persons also came to light that they had hatched\nconspiracy  for  the  commission  of  the  crime  in  question.  Some  of  the\naccused persons were arrested while others surrendered in court and after\ncompletion  of  investigation  charge  sheet  was  prepared  against  all  the\naccused persons who had been either arrested by him or has surrendered in\ncourt and also against Upendra alias Guddu, Pappu, Dheeraj and Devendra\nwho were then still absconding. Later on accused Pappu alias Amarjeet and\nRajveer were also arrested. It was also revealed that accused Upendra alias\n5\nGuddu was in jail after having been arrested in a case under Gangster Act.\nSimilarly, accused Dheeraj was in jail in connection with case Crime No.\n628 of 1993 under Section 307 I.P.C.\nSmt.  Bala  (PW.1)  who  is  alleged  to  have  herself  received  injuries\nduring  the  course  of  incident  got  the  first  information  report  Ex.  Ka.  I\nscribed  by  Km.  Guddi,  her  niece.  Km.  Guddi  is  also  alleged  to  have\nsustained  injuries  during  the  course  of  the  same  incident  but  she  was\nmurdered before she could be examined in the trial court as a witness.\nThe case as set out in the first information report in short  was that\nsome incident had occurred in the year 1986 between family members of\ncomplainant and accused Mukesh and Guddu sons of Rajveer and the matter\nwas  reported  at  the  police  station  from complainant's  side.  A  case  was\nproceeding in court at Hapur some time before the present incident and the\npolice had raided the house of accused Mukesh. Mukesh and Guddu, came\nto the house of Sheo Pal Singh and gave threats to them saying that they had\nnot done good by getting his house raided. The accused persons were thus\nbearing enmity with Sheo Pal and others.\n6\nIt was further alleged in the report lodged by Smt. Bala that in the\nnight between 30/31 August, 1994 at about 12.30 A.M. Mukesh and Guddu\nof her  own village carrying country made pistols  with them and accused\nSattan of village Lohari also having a country made pistols alongwith 4-5\nunknown persons who were also having weapons like pistols, Dalkati, Lathi\netc. entered into her house. At that time electric bulbs were emitting light\ninside and out side the house. The family members of her Jeth, Sheo pal\nSingh were sleeping on cots outside the house. She herself (Smt. Bala) was\nresting inside the house, while her husband Shiv Singh was sleeping on the\nroof.  The accused persons after making entry into the house immediately\nstarted hurling abuses by name to her Jeth Sheo Pal Singh saying that he\nwas  acting  as  an  informer  to  police,  hence  he  and  his  family would  be\neliminated completely. Hearing it Sheo Pal got up and started running but\nhe was chased by accused Mukesh and Sattan and was shot dead in the Gher\nof  Devendra.  Mukesh  and  Sattan  then  said  that  entire  family  should  be\nfinished and thereafter accused persons killed Kunti Devi, wife; of Sheo Pal,\nKhushal son of Sheo Pal and Manjeet son of Shiv Singh. They also injured\nNeetu son of Sheo Pal, Guddi, daughter of Sheo Pal Singh and baby Kapil\nabout 3 years old son of' Shiv Singh. Mukesh and Sattan with his associates\nclimbed over the roof and murdered her husband Shiv Singh on the cot on\n7\nwhich  he  was  sleeping.",

RAY,J.\n     Leave granted.\n     This appeal  is directed  against judgment  dated March\n22, 1995  passed by the Division Bench, Rajasthan High Court\n(Jodhpur Bench).  By the  impugned judgment,  the High Court\naffirmed the death sentence passed by the learned Additional\nSessions  Judge,  Banswara,  in  Sessions  Case  No.  122/93\nagainst the  appellant in D.B. Criminal Murder Reference No.\n3/94 and  dismissed D.B.  Criminal (Jail). Appeal No. 602/94\npreferred by the appellant before the High Court against the\nconviction under  Section 302  I.P.C. and  sentence of death\nawarded against him by the learned Additional Sessions Judge\nin the said Sessions Case No. 122/93.\n     The appellant  sent a  special leave  petition from the\nJail where he is lodged. Initially a learned counsel of this\nCourt was  appointed as  Amicus Curiae to represent the case\nof the  appellant. Later on, the appellant wrote a letter to\nthe Registry of this Court expressing his intention that one\nof the three advocates mentioned by him in his letter may be\nengaged to represent his case before this Court. Pursuant to\nsuch request, Mr. Natarajan, a senior advocate of this Court\nagreed to appear as amicus curiae in deference to the desire\nof the  appellant. We appreciate such gesture on the part of\nMr. Natarajan,  for accepting  the case  of the appellant as\namicus curiae.\n     The appellant  was committed  to a  Sessions  Trial  in\nSessions Case  No.  122/93  before  the  learned  Additional\nSessions Judge, Banswara, on the charge of committing murder\nof five  persons including  the wife and three minor sons of\nthe appellant  and attempting  to murder  his own mother and\nthe wife  of a  neighbour. The  trial court after relying on\nthe evidences  of witnesses  including injured eye-witnesses\ninter alia  came to  the finding  that the  prosecution  had\nestablished by  leading cogent  evidence that  the appellant\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 11 \nwas guilty  of murdering five persons and he was also guilty\nfor attempting to murder his mother Smt. Mangi (PW 12) and a\nneighbour’s wife  Smt. Galal  (PW 4).  Considering the  fact\nthat the  commission of  the said murders was committed in a\nbrutal and barbaric manner, the trial court after convicting\nthe appellant  under Sections 302 IPC sentenced him to death\npenalty.  Such   sentence  of  death  was  referred  to  the\nRajasthan High  Court for  confirmation. The  reference  for\nconfirmation of death sentence was numbered as D.B. Criminal\nMurder Reference  No.3/94. The  appellant also  preferred an\nappeal against his conviction and sentence passed by learned\nAdditional Sessions  Judge in Sessions Case No. 122/93. Such\nappeal was  numbered as  D.B.  Criminal  (Jail)  Appeal  No.\n602/94. Both  the said  Murder Reference  No. 3/94  and Jail\nAppeal No.  602/94 were  disposed of  by the High Court by a\ncommon  judgment   dated  March  22,  1995,  dismissing  the\nCriminal Appeal No. 602/94 and confirming the death sentence\nby allowing Murder Reference No. 3/94.\n     Mr. Natarajan,  the learned senior counsel appearing as\namicus curiae  for the  appellant, has submitted that in the\ninstant case  there is  no  direct  evidence  regarding  the\nallegation of murdering four persons by the appellant namely\nhis wife  and three  minor children. Admittedly, besides the\nsaid dead  persons, only mother of the appellant was present\nin the  house at  the  time  of  murdering  wife  and  minor\nchildren of  the appellant.  The  mother  of  the  appellant\nherself was  injured  by  the  assailant  who  had  murdered\nappellant’s wife  and three  minor children.  But the mother\nwho was  examined as  PW 12  did not support the prosecution\ncase. She  has deposed that some unknown person murdered her\ndaughter-in-law and  three grand  children and  also injured\nher. She  was declared  hostile by  the prosecution.  Hence,\nthere is  no direct evidence that the appellant had murdered\nhis wife and three minor sons. The prosecution case has been\nsought to  be proved  by circumstantial evidence. But motive\nfor murdering  wife and  three minor sons is totally absent.\nIn  a   case  of  circumstantial  evidence,  motive  assumes\nconsiderable significance.  Mr. Natarajan has submitted that\neven if  this court  accepts the  concurrent finding  of the\ncourts below  that appellant is guilty of murdering his wife\nand three  minor  children  besides  murdering  another  man\nGulabji the  absence of motive requires to be considered for\nsustaining the  death penalty.  Mr. Natarajan  has submitted\nthat there  are eye-witnesses  to prove the prosecution case\nof murdering  Gulabji and  attempting to  murder Smt. Galal.\nThe wife  of Gulabji  before whose eyes Gulabji was murdered\nand Smt.  Galal  herself  has  deposed  in  support  of  the\nprosecution case.  The finding  by the Courts below that the\nappellant has  murdered Gulabji cannot be said to be without\nany basis  and he  fairly concedes that an attempt to assail\nsuch finding  may be  an exercise in futility. Mr. Natarajan\nhas, therefore,  submitted that in the facts of the case, it\nwill be  only appropriate  for him to confine his submission\non the  question  of  sentence  to  be  passed  against  the\nappellant.\n     Mr. Natarajan  has submitted that unfortunately in this\ncase, the  prosecution has failed to lead any evidence as to\nwhy the  appellant suddenly  killed  his  wife  who  was  in\nadvanced stage  of pregnancy  and three  minor children when\nhis wife  and his  three minor  children were  asleep in his\nhouse. Mr. Natarajan has also submitted that the prosecution\nhas also  failed to lead any evidence to indicate or even to\nsuggest as  to what was or could be the motive that impelled\nthe appellant immediately after murdering his wife and three\nminor children and injuring his own mother when she tried to\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 11 \nprevent him  from committing  such crime,  to  rush  to  his\nneighbour’s house  and to  attempt to  kill the  wife of the\nneighbour Smt. Galal (PW 4) who was admittedly then sleeping\nwith her daughter in their house. He has also submitted that\nunfortunately, there  is also  no evidence  from  which  any\nmotive can even remotely be inferred as to why the appellant\nthereafter killed  another neighbour,  an elderly  man  with\nwhom appellant  had no enmity, when the said old man Gulabji\nwas coming towards the house of Smt. Galal after hearing her\nshrieks on being injured by the appellant.\n     Mr. Natarajan  has submitted  that there is no evidence\nto  suggest  that  the  appellant  had  ever  suspected  the\nfidelity of  the wife  or any  extra marital relationship of\nhis wife  with anybody  or with  the neighbour,  namely  the\nhusband of  Smt. Galal. There is not even any whisper by the\nprosecution witnesses  that Smt.  Galal had  in  any  manner\ncaused annoyance  to the appellant and had ever attempted to\ndisturb the  conjugal life  of the  appellant so  that there\nmight be  an occasion  for the  appellant to  entertain some\nwrath or hatred against PW 4 Smt. Galal.\n     Mr. Natarajan has submitted that commission of crime is\nperpetrated for some reason which may be even ill founded or\nill-conceived. Sudden fit of passion, anger etc. actuated by\nvarious  considerations  like  hatred,  wrath,  a  sense  of\nrevenge etc. often induce an accused to commit murder.",

Balakrishnan & B.N. Srikrishna.\nJUDGMENT:\nJ U D G M E N T\nK.G. BALAKRISHNAN, J.\n        The appellants Gurdev Singh and Satnam  Singh were tried  by  the Addl. \nSessions  Judge, Amritsar,   and found guilty of offence punishable under \nSection 302  read with Section 149 IPC and other allied offences.  As per the \nprosecution case, these appellants, along with three others had caused the death \nof 17 persons.   The  Addl.  Sessions Judge held that the prosecution proved \nbeyond reasonable doubt that these appellants were members of an unlawful \nassembly which accomplished  its common object  of causing death of 15 \npersons.  These appellants were convicted and sentenced to death.   They \npreferred an appeal before the High Court of Punjab and  Haryana and the \nmatter was also referred to the High Court for confirmation of the death sentence.  \nThe High Court affirmed the death sentence in respect of  these  appellants.  \nThese appellants challenge the judgment of the High Court.\n        Though the incident occurred on  21.11.1991, these appellants were \nabsconding and could be apprehended only on 26.8.1996 whereas the  other \nthree accused, namely, Piara Singh, Sarabjit Singh (Appellants in Criminal \nAppeal No. 393  of  2002) and Jasvinder Singh were tried by Sessions Judge, \nAmritsar, in Sessions Case No. 94 of 1992 and the Sessions Judge held that \nPiara Singh and Sarabjit Singh were members of an unlawful assembly whose \ncommon object was to kill 15 persons. By judgment dated 15.1.1996 the \nSessions Court  found Piara Singh and Sarabjit Singh guilty of offence \npunishable under Section 302 read with Section 149 IPC and sentenced  them to \ndeath.    Another accused, Jasvinder Singh was acquitted on the ground of \nbenefit of doubt.     Piara Singh and  Sarabjit Singh filed an appeal before the \nHigh Court and there was also a reference regarding confirmation of the death \nsentence.   The appeal preferred by them was dismissed and the High Court \nconfirmed the death sentence imposed on  Piara Singh and Sarabjit Singh.   \nThey filed an SLP registered as  Special Leave Petition (Criminal) No. 275 of \n1997 challenging their conviction and sentence.   The Special Leave Petition was \ndisposed of on 28.2.1997 with the following order :\n\"We have heard learned counsel for the parties at great length and \nhave also gone through the record submitted along with the appeal \nas well as the judgments of the courts below.   In our view, the \njudgment and orders of the High Court require no inteference.   The \nSpecial Leave Petition is therefore dismissed.\"\nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 8 \nThey also filed a  Review Petition,  which was dismissed.\n        When  the Special Leave Petition (Criminal) preferred by Gurdev Singh \nand Satnam Singh  came up for consideration, the counsel  brought to the \nattention of the Court the decision of this Court  in    Harbans Singh vs. State of \nUttar Pradesh and Ors. (1982) 2 SCC 101 and prayed for recalling the order of \ndismissal dated  28.2.1997 passed earlier in Special Leave Petition (Criminal) \nNo. 275 of 1997  which had been preferred by Piara Singh and Sarabjit Singh.   \nBy order dated 18.3.2002, this Court  directed that in view of the decision in \nHarbans Singh’s case (supra), the order of dismissal dated 28.2.1997 in Special \nLeave Petition (Crl.) No. 275 of 1997 be recalled and leave was granted.  \nSimultaneously, this Court  stayed the execution of death sentence on Piara \nSingh and Sarabjit Singh.  Subsequent to this order, the Registry numbered their \nappeal as  Criminal Appeal No. 393 of 2002 and posted the same to be heard \nalong with the present  Criminal Appeal No. 392 of 2002.\n        At the outset, we must say that  the decision of this  Court in Harbans \nSingh’s case (supra) does not lay down any rule that an Appeal/Special Leave \nPetition already disposed of by  this Court is to be re-heard when an appeal  \npreferred by another set of accused involved in the  same incident comes up for \nconsideration at a later stage.    In Harbans Singh’s case, four  accused were \nfound guilty of murder and other  offences and they were  sentenced to death.   \nThe High Court confirmed the death sentence.   After their conviction and \nsentence, one of the convict died and the other three convicts  filed separate  \nspecial leave  petitions before this Court.   The first special leave petition when \ncame up for consideration, was dismissed and  the death sentence imposed on \nthe convict was confirmed.  In the second special leave petition filed by another \nconvict which came up for consideration before a different Bench of this Court,   \nleave was granted  and the death sentence  was commuted to life imprisonment.      \nIn the third petition preferred by yet another convict, the death sentence imposed \non him was confirmed.  His petition for mercy was dismissed by the President of \nIndia.   When the date of execution of death sentence was fixed, he filed a writ \npetition under Article 32 contending that   his co-accused escaped the death \nsentence, therefore,  the death sentence imposed on him be also commuted to  \nlife imprisonment.      It is pertinent to note that this Court did not commute the \nsentence of death imposed on him to life imprisonment and observed that in the \ninterest of comity   between the powers of this Court and the powers of the \nPresident of India it will be more in the fitness of things if the Court recommends \nto the President for commutation of death sentence to life imprisonment in \nexercise of power under Article 72.   It is also to be noticed that the petitioner \ntherein was tried along with three others and in the case of one of his co-\naccused, the sentence of death was commuted to life imprisonment.\n        In the present appeals, appellants Gurdev Singh and Satnam Singh were \nnot tried along with appellants Piara Singh and Sarabjit Singh.  As appellants \nGurdev Singh and Satnam Singh were absconding, they could be tried only \nsubsequently in a separate trial.    As the Special Leave Petition of Piara Singh \nand Sarabjit Singh came to be finally disposed of  on  28.2.1997 and the \nconviction and sentence entered against them attained finality, we do not think \nthat it is just,  proper and legal to hear the appeal and consider the question \ninvolved therein on merits again.   Therefore, the Criminal Appeal No. 393 of \n2002  (corresponding number assigned  by the Registry to SLP(Crl.) No. 275 of \n1997)  is only to be dismissed and we do so and  vacate  the stay of execution of \nthe death sentence imposed on the appellants therein.\n        In the Criminal  Appeal No. 392 of 2002, the case of the prosecution is \nthat the appellants, Gurudev Singh and Satnam Singh, along with three other \naccused went to the house of Smt.

Appellant\nVersus\nState of West Bengal …. Respondent\nJ U D G M E N T\nV.S. SIRPURKAR, J.\n1. Appellant  herein  Haru  Ghosh  has  come up  by way of  this  appeal,  challenging  the \njudgment of the High Court, whereby, the High Court confirmed the verdict of conviction, as also \nthe death sentence awarded by the Sessions Judge.  Appellant was tried for having committed \nmurder of one Anima Pramanik, aged about 30 years and her son Subhankar Pramanik @ Kebal, \naged about 12 years.  He was also tried for the offence under Section 307-326 of the Indian Penal \nCode (hereinafter referred to as “IPC” for short)  for attempting to murder one Jeevan Krishna \nChakraborty, aged about 60 years.\n2. The prosecution case was that on 7.5.2005, at about 11.15 hours, a telephonic message \nwas received by N.C. Mondal (PW-37), an Assistant Sub-Inspector of Nawadeep Police Station, \ninforming that between 10.45 Hrs. and 11.10 hrs. on that day, one Haru Ghosh S/o Mohan Ghosh, \nstaying at Ramchandrapur Ghoshpara assaulted three persons of the said village by a sharp cutting \ndao and also tried to assault others and for that, the police help was immediately needed.  The \nmessage was recorded in the General Diary vide Entry No. 300.  One Shri Amitava Ghosh (PW-\n39), Inspector-in-Charge, reached the spot immediately at about 11.25 hours.  The said message \nwas sent by Samir Ghosh (PW-1), who narrated the incident to them.  The bodies of a female and a \nmale child were lying near the tubewell of the house of the victims.  On this basis, the further \ninvestigation was taken up.  It came out from the complaint of the complainant Samir Ghosh (PW-\n1) that  he had heard some cries  from the  house  of  the  deceased  and rushed  only to  find the \nappellant/accused strangulating Subhankar  Pramanik.   On the  intervention  of  the  complainant, \nSubhankar was released from the clutches of Haru Ghosh and he was bleeding, therefore, Anima \n(mother of Subhankar) took him to the nearby tubewell and was pouring water on his face.  It \nfurther came out that while she was pouring water, at that time one Shyamal Ghosh, a neighbour, \nwas watching the incident with a dao in his hand.  Haru snatched the dao from Shyamal and started \nassaulting Subhankar and Anima with that dao, as a result of which both of them collapsed on the \nground with severe bleeding injuries.  Thereafter, Haru ran away with the dao and only after few \nminutes later, the informant-complainant Samir Ghosh (PW-1) came to know that Haru had also \ngone to Jeevan Krishna Chakraborty’s house and hacked him and also to the house of one or two \nothers and had injured them with the aforesaid  dao.  Prosecution collected the statements of the \nwitnesses, who were Samir Ghosh (PW-1), Sabitri Ghosh (PW-2), Adhir (PW-8) and wife of Adhir \nnamely Bandana (PW-3).  It came out from the statements that these persons had intervened when \nSubhankar was assaulted by Haru and had rescued him.  The statement of one Atasi Ghosh (PW-5) \nand Shyamal Ghosh (PW-6) was also collected.  One Namita Ghosh (PW-4), a neighbour, was also \nquestioned  by the  investigating  agency,  as  also  Sikha  (PW-10),  who  was  none  else,  but  the \ndaughter-in-law of Jeevan Krishna Chakraborty, who was a member of Gram Panchayat.\n3. It transpired further that Jeevan Krishna Chakraborty though was assaulted severally; his \nstatement also came to be recorded.  The statements of some others present in the house of Jeevan \nKrishna Chakraborty were also collected by the prosecution.  Thus the prosecution collected the \nstatements of about 36 witnesses.  On this basis, the charge sheet was filed.\n4. It also turned out during the investigation that Haru Ghosh was already undergoing the \nsentence of life imprisonment in one other matter and he had come back from the jail on bail.  It \nfurther transpired that the motive for this dastardly act on the part of the appellant/accused was that \nthe accused used to sell illicit liquor and all persons in the neighbourhood including the husband of \nthe deceased Anima used to ask him not to sell illicit liquor in the locality.  It also turned out that \nthe appellant/accused had cut down about 75 banana trees and there was a report made, on account \nof which, it came out that the appellant/accused was a bully in the locality.  On this basis, the \ninvestigating agency filed a charge sheet against the appellant/accused.   The appellant/accused \nabjured the guilt.  His plea was that of false implication.\n5. In support of the prosecution, as many as 36 witnesses came to be examined, the main \nwitnesses being Samir Ghosh (PW-1),  Sabitri  Ghosh (PW-2), Namita Ghosh (PW-4), Shyamal \nGhosh (PW-6), Adhir Ghosh (PW-8) and his wife Bandana Ghosh (PW-3) and Atasi Ghosh (PW-\n5).  On the first part of the incident, i.e., about the assault by the appellant/accused on Anima and \nSubhankar, both of whom died on the spot, and as regards the second part, i.e., about the assault of \nJeevan Krishna Chakraborty, he himself was examined as PW-12.  The supporting witnesses to the \nsecond assault were Sikha Chakraborty (PW-10), Jayanta Chakraborty (PW-29), Uttam Saha (PW-\n30), Nilmoni Ghosh (PW-13), Susanta Chakraborty S/o Jeevan Krishna Chakraborty (PW-27) etc. \nThere are some other witnesses who were examined to corroborate these witnesses, who were the \neye witnesses.  The prosecution also led the evidence of Dr. Kanchan Kumar Sarkar (PW-34), \nSakshi  Ghosh (PW-7), Bahadur Ghosh (PW-9), Biswajit  Ghosh (PW-17) and Dr. Jahnunandan \nMisra.  The evidence of police witnesses was also led and after all the evidence, the Sessions Judge \ncame to the conclusion that it was proved beyond reasonable doubt by the prosecution that the \nappellant/accused  had  committed  the  murder  of  Anima and  Subhankar  and  also  attempted  to \nmurder Jeevan Krishna Chakraborty.  The appellant/accused was sentenced to death on account of \nthe murder of Anima and Subhankar and was also convicted to suffer the rigorous imprisonment \nfor seven years and payment of Rs. 5,000/-, and in default, to suffer six months’ imprisonment on \naccount of offence punishable under Section 307, IPC.  Strangely enough, he was also sentenced to \nsuffer rigorous imprisonment for 5 years and to pay Rs.5,000/- and in default, to suffer further \nrigorous imprisonment for 3 months for the offence punishable under Section 326, IPC.  This was \nconfirmed by the High Court, necessitating the present appeal.  \n6. Shri Mata Prasad Singh, the Amicus Curiae appointed by this Court took us through the \nevidence of all the witnesses.  All that we can say is that there is voluminous evidence in respect of \nboth the incidents, namely, the murder of Anima and Subhankar and the attempt to commit murder \nof Jeevan Krishna Chakraborty.  The first group of witnesses Samir Ghosh (PW-1), Sabitri Ghosh \n(PW-2), Adhir Ghosh (PW-8), Bandana Ghosh (PW-3), Namita Ghosh (PW-4), Atasi Ghosh (PW-\n5)  and  Shyamal  Ghosh  (PW-6)  were  all  neighbouring  witnesses.   They have  all  graphically \ndescribed the attack on Anima and Subhankar.  They were the witnesses who actually went on the \nspot to save Subhankar who was being strangulated by the appellant/accused.  They have all, in one \ntone,  described how the  appellant/accused tried  to  strangulate  Subhankar  and how Anima got \ninjured because of that.  They have also described that thereafter, Subhankar was bleeding and was \ntaken near the tube-well by Anima who was trying to wash his mouth and at that time Haru, the \npresent appellant, snatched  dao from the hand of Shyamal Ghosh and assaulted them.  Shyamal \nGhosh (PW-6) has in no uncertain terms supported the prosecution theory.  It was he from whose \nhands the murder weapon was snatched.  Sakshi Ghosh (PW-7) was also attracted by the hue and \ncry and had also seen the whole incident.  Adhir Ghosh (PW-8) is husband of Bandana Ghosh \nwhose evidence we have already referred to.  He has also seen and graphically described the whole \nincident.   All  these  witnesses  have  graphically  spoken  about  the  murderous  attack  by  the \nappellant/accused on Subhankar and Anima.  We have very carefully seen the cross-examination \nand nothing has come from these witnesses which would render the evidence suspicious in any \nmanner.  \n7. In that light when we see the evidence of Dr. Rathindra Nath Haldar (PW-18), who \nperformed the post-mortem on the body of  Anima and Subhankar,  we are  convinced that  the \nappellant/accused had no other intention but to commit murder.  Anima had suffered as many as \nsix injuries referable to the sharp cutting weapon on the most vital parts of her body like neck.  As \nmany as four injuries were found to be on her neck resulting in cutting of vertebra, the fracture of \nmandible bone etc.  The other two injuries were on her thigh and left knee joint.  In comparison, \nSubhankar had suffered 10 injuries on the equally vital parts of the body like head, right eye, face, \nshoulders, and right arm by way of injury No. 10.  His wrist of the right hand was separated from \nthe hand completely.",

            "content":"http://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 1 of 5 \nCASE NO.:\nAppeal (crl.)  656 of 2004\nPETITIONER:\nSaibanna\nRESPONDENT:\nState of Karnataka\nDATE OF JUDGMENT: 21/04/2005\nBENCH:\nK. G. Balakrishnan & B. N. Srikrishna\nJUDGMENT:\nJ U D G M E N T\nB.N.SRIKRISHNA, J.\n        This appeal arises out of a judgment of the High Court of Karnataka \nupholding the conviction of the appellant on the charge of Section 302 and \nconfirming the death penalty imposed on the accused-appellant.\n        The appellant-Saibanna was convicted for the murder of his wife-\nNagamma, aged about 22 years, and his daughter-Vijayalakshmi, aged about \n1= years. The appellant had earlier committed murder of his first wife-\nMalakawwa for which he was convicted in Sessions Case No. 32/88. While \nthe appellant was an under trial prisoner, he came into contact with PW 1-\nDattu, who was also an under trial prisoner. PW 1-Dattu is the father of the \ndeceased, Smt. Nagamma. The appellant persuaded PW 1 to give his \ndaughter- Nagamma in marriage to him. PW 1 also gave an assurance to the \nappellant that he would try and get the appellant acquitted in the case against \nhim.  Later on, PW 1-Dattu was discharged by the court. During the period of \nthe trial, the appellant was on bail for sometime and he utilised this for getting \nmarried to Nagamma.  He also begot a female child Vijayalakshmi  from her. \nHe was thereafter convicted in Sessions Case No. 32/88 and was handed \ndown a sentence of life imprisonment. His appeal against conviction in that \ncase was dismissed by the High Court of Karnataka.\n        While serving the sentence of life imprisonment, the appellant was \nreleased on parole for a period of one month on 19th August, 1994.  On       \n12th September, 1994, the appellant along with his wife, deceased Nagamma, \ntheir child, Vijayalakshmi, PW 21-Sharanawwa, Mahantappa and others went \nin a jeep to the house of PW 1-Dattu at Bhosga Village. They had a festivity \nand a good festive meal. Thereafter, the appellant, Smt. Nagamma, child \nVijayalakshmi, PW 1-Dattu, PW 21-Sharanawwa and Mahantappa went to \nthe newly constructed house of  PW 6-Hanumanthappa (brother of PW 1)  to \nsleep there.  During the night, suspecting the fidelity of his second wife, \nNagamma, the appellant assaulted her with a jambia ( a sort of long bladed \nknife used for attack or hunting) and inflicted 21 injuries. On being assaulted, \nand grievously injured, she ran out of the room and fell outside the room \nwhere PW 1 and  PW 21 were sleeping.  The accused also assaulted the minor \nchild Vijayalakshmi with the jambia and inflicted 6 injuries on her.  He also \nattempted to commit suicide by inflicting injuries on his person.  As a result \nof the injuries inflicted, both Nagamma and minor child Vijayalakshmi died, \nbut the appellant survived to face the trial.\n        The first information was lodged by PW 1 at 8:15 a.m. in the morning \nof 13th September, 1994 with the jurisdictional police at Afzalpur. The First \nInformation Report was registered in Crime No. 59/94 for the offence under \nSections 303, 307 and 309 IPC.  The police carried out investigations during \nthe course of which the bodies were subjected to autopsy, necessary mahazars \nwere carried out, weapons lying at the spot were seized, clothes of the \ndeceased and of the accused were also seized.  Statements of  material \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 2 of 5 \nwitnesses came to be recorded after which the charge sheet was filed against \nthe accused-appellant.\n        The prosecution examined in all 26 witnesses and got marked Ex. P 1 \nto P 24 as well as M.Os. 1 to 17.  PW 21-Sharanawwa is the mother-in-law of \nthe younger brother of the appellant.  Her evidence is most crucial. She stated \nin her evidence that a day earlier to the incident when she was in Mandewal  \nVillage, the appellant came there and took her along with his deceased wife-\nNagamma, deceased daughter-Vijayalakshmi and PW 5-Shashikala to Bhosga \nVillage where the parental house of Nagamma is situated.  When all of them \nwent to the house of PW 1, the appellant requested the parents of the \ndeceased, i.e., PW 1 and PW 8, to get him released from jail and they \npromised that they would try their best to do so.  Thereafter, all of them took \ndinner after which PW 21, appellant-Saibanna, deceased Nagamma, deceased \nVijayalakshmi and Mahantappa (grand-son of PW 21) went to the new house \nbelonging to the brother of PW 1 for sleeping during the night.  The witness \nstated that the appellant, his wife-Nagamma and his daughter-Vijayalakshmi \nslept in one room while PW 21 and her grand-son, Mahantappa, slept in \nanother room. As there were lot of mosquitoes troubling them, PW 21 and \nMahantappa came out of the room where they were initially sleeping and \nslept outside in the verandah. In the middle of the night, PW 21 heard some \nnoise and came awake.  She saw  Saibanna-appellant assaulting his wife \nNagamma with a knife on her chest, stomach and other parts. The injured \nNagamma came out of the room shouting followed by the appellant who \ncontinued to assault her outside the room also.  Upon being questioned as to \nwhy he was assaulting Nagamma, the appellant gave no reply, but went inside \nthe room and also assaulted his daughter Vijayalakshmi and inflicted injuries \non his own person with the same weapon.  All this was noticed, according to \nwitness PW 21, as there was a chimney lamp at the place which was burning.  \nThe cross-examination of this witness produced no such discrepancies or \ncontradictions which could have led to disbelieving the witness. The trial \ncourt and the High Court have completely believed this witness, particularly, \nwhen no ill-will or animosity of this witness towards the accused was even \nremotely suggested. The fact that she was the close relative of the appellant \n(mother-in-law of the younger brother of the appellant) and  that she was aged \nabout 70 years and would gain nothing by levelling a false allegation on the \nappellant also weighed in the courts. The other witnesses examined were \ncircumstantial witnesses. PWs. 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 12 and 16 who were post-\nincident witnesses, who spoke about the presence of PW 21 at that spot and \nseeing the injuries on both the deceased and also on the accused.  To that \nextent, their evidence is corroborative. Vijayalakshmi and the appellant in the \ninjured state were taken to a Doctor for medical aid. The Doctor-PW 10 had \nnoticed the injuries on both of them. PW 10 clearly opined that the injuries \nfound on the body of the accused were self-inflicted.  The High Court \naccepted the evidence of PW 10 and also noticed that the complaints/First \nInformation Report had been lodged without delay. Even in his statement \nunder Section 313 of the Criminal Procedure Code, the appellant admitted his \npresence at the time of the offence, but denied the other incriminatory \ncircumstances put to him. \nUpon careful consideration of the entire material evidence, both the \nSessions Court and the High Court concurrently found that the prosecution \nhad proved beyond reasonable doubt that the accused was guilty of the \noffence under Section 302 IPC. Although, originally the accused had been \ncharged under Section 303 IPC, when the Sessions Court was at the stage of \nsentencing, it was brought to its attention that Section 303 IPC had been \nstruck down as unconstitutional by this Court in Mithu  v.  State of Punjab . \nThe Sessions Court was of the view that,  on the evidence, the charge of \nSection 302 IPC was made out and the appellant could be convicted of \noffence under Section 302 IPC as there was no prejudice caused to him by the \nchange of the charge.\n        The Sessions Court took the view that the case belonged to the category \nof \"rarest of rare cases\" and that there were no mitigating circumstances and \nthat the only condign punishment was sentence of death.  In the High Court,  \nhowever, there was disagreement between the two learned Judges hearing the \nhttp://JUDIS.NIC.IN SUPREME COURT OF INDIA Page 3 of 5 \nappeal and the confirmation reference. One learned Judge took the view that \nthe appropriate punishment would be life imprisonment, while the other took \nthe view that it was a fit case in which death sentence had to be imposed. The \ncase was placed before a third learned Judge of the High Court, who took the \nview that the case at hand was a \"rarest of rare case\" involving pre-planned \nbrutal murders without provocation and, hence, a fit case where the death \nsentence imposed by the Sessions Court had to be confirmed.\n        The learned counsel for the appellant and the State have taken us \nthrough the record.  We have also heard the learned counsel on both sides and \nconcur with the finding of the Sessions Court as well as the High Court in \nappeal that the appellant is guilty of the offence of murder under Section 302 \nIPC of his wife-Nagamma and his minor daughter-Vijayalakshmi.  The \nquestion is, what should be the appropriate punishment to be imposed in this \ncase ?\nIn the case of Bachan Singh  v.  State of Punjab   the constitutional \nvalidity of the provision for death penalty was upheld. The Constitutional \nBench pointed out that the present legislative policy discernible from Section \n235(2) read with Section 354(3) of the Code of Criminal Procedure is that \"it \nis only when the culpability assumes the proportion of total depravity that \n’special reason’  within the meaning of section 354(3) for imposition of the \ndeath sentence can be said to exist\".  Broad illustrative guidelines of such \ninstances were also indicated therein.",

It is stated that\nthe packet in which the “LIFEBUOY” soap is sold and distributed throughout\nIndia has a distinctive style, getup and colour scheme and a large quantity of\nsoap has been sold in India in the said labels/packets by reason whereof the said\nmarks have become very well-known and has become distinctive of the soap of\nthe petitioner. The soap of the petitioner sold under the trade mark “LIFEBUOY”\nhas acquired a substantial reputation and goodwill in the market. The petitioner\nhas also given the figures of the All India annual sale of products of the petitioner\ncompany with trade mark “LIFEBUOY” and expenses incurred in advertising.\nMr. Arunabha Deb, appearing on behalf of the petitioner submits that in\nthe month of January, 2019 in course of a market survey and investigation\n2\ncarried out by the petitioner at Jaipur, Rajasthan, it was found that the\nrespondents were manufacturing, selling and distributing soap under the marks\n“LIKEBOY”and “LOVEBOY” in packets having trade design, graphics and a colour\nscheme similar if not identical to the label in which the Petitioner’s product\n“LIFEBUOY” is sold and distributed in India. A mere comparison of the\nlabels/packets of the petitioner with those of the respondents would indicate an\nidentical colour scheme as well as the infringing use of the petitioner’s copyright\nsubsisting in the labels in which its product “LIFEBUOY” is sold. Further, the\npetitioner is the registered proprietor of the word mark “LIFEBUOY” and the\nrespondents are using the names “LIKEBOY” and “LOVEBOY”, which are\ndeceptively similar to the petitioner’s registered word mark  “LIFEBUOY”.\nIt appears that the infringing packets in which the soaps of the\nrespondents are sold are a colourable and deceptive imitation of the label of the\npetitioner’s “LIFEBUOY” and the words “LIKEBOY” and “LOVEBOY”  phonitically,\nvisually and structually are deceptively similar to the petitioner’s registered word\nmark “LIFEBUOY”.\nThis Court is, prima facie, satisfied that the products sold by the\ndefendants are in infringement of the petitioner’s trade mark and copyright\nsubsisting in the labels in which the petitioner’s product “LIFEBUOY” is sold and\nare also in infringement of the petitioner’s registered wordmark “LIFEBUOY”. On\nthe aforesaid prima facie satisfaction, in my view, a protective order is required to\nbe passed, otherwise the infringing packets may be removed out of reach of the\nCourt. In view thereof, there shall be an order in terms of prayer (b) of the\napplication.\nI appoint Mr. Tirthankar Nandi, Advocate of as Special Officer to\nimmediately visit the godown and the outlet of the defendants to inventorize the\ninfringing goods, if required, with the police assistance and keep the seized\nmaterials/goods at the place to be provided by the petitioner. The Special Officer\nshall be at liberty to break open padlock(s), if required, in presence of police\n3\nauthorities in the event the respondent(s) or the godown owner(s) is unable to\nprovide the key(s) to the Special Officer. The godown shall be resealed and the\nkey(s) shall be kept in the custody of the Special Officer until further orders. The\nSpecial Officer shall be entitled to an initial remuneration of 2000 GMs. All\narrangements for the Special Officer’s travel, accommodation and the like shall\nbe made by the petitioner and the expenses therefor. The Special Officer shall file\na report on the returnable date.\nLet this application appear on 25th February, 2019.\nThe petitioner is directed to communicate this order along with a copy of\nthis application and a copy of the plaint upon the respondents by speed post with\nacknowledgement due within 5th February, 2019 and shall file affidavit of service\non the adjourned date.\nThe interim order shall be for a period of ten weeks from date or until\nfurther orders, whichever is earlier.\nThe respondents shall be at liberty to apply for vacation, variation and/or\nmodification of the interim order upon notice to the petitioner.\n Urgent certified website copies of this order, if applied for, be urgently\nsupplied to the parties subject to compliance with all requisite formalities.\n(SOUMEN SEN, J.)\nsp/\n",

Mukhopadhyay, Adv.\n     The Court: In an action for infringement of the registered trademark\n“Khadim’s” this application has been filed for interim reliefs.  The plaintiff is the\noriginal owner of the trademark “Khadim”.  The petitioner claims that the\ntrademark “Khadim’s” was adopted and used continuously and extensively since\n1960 by the predecessors in interest of the present petitioner and thereafter, by\nthe present petitioner.  The trademark has distinguished and still continues to\ndistinguish the goods of he petitioner from those of all others and indicates a\nconnection in the course of trade with the goods of the petitioner and is\nassociated in the minds of the public and others.  The petitioner has also\ndisclosed the annual turnover as well as the expenses incurred for marketing,\npromotion, advertisement and sale of its products under the trade and house\n2\nmark lebel “Khadim’s”.  The petitioner has also disclosed a list of trademark and\ncopyright registration in respect of “Khadim’s” along with certificates and\nrenewals of such trademark in Annexure A to the petition.  The petitioner alleged\nthat the respondent no. 2 was a franchisee of the plaintiff and the said agreement\nhad expired by efflux of time.  The agreement is no more in force.  The\nrespondent however is carrying on its business by using the trademark\n“Khadams” which is deceptively similar to the trademark of the plaintiff.  On a\nvisual comparison of the infringing mark with the trademark of the plaintiff as\nwell as the copyright of the plaintiff it appears that the defendant’s trademark\n“Khadams” is a slavish imitation of the plaintiff’s trademark “Khadim’s”.  The\noverall get up lay out of the infringing mark bears a significant resemblance to\nthe existing trademark of the plaintiff including the copyright.  The impugned\nmark “Khadams” is phonetically, visually and structurally similar to the\ntrademark “Khadim”.  The adoption of the said infringing mark appears to be\ndishonest.  The plaintiff has made out a strong prima facie case in favour of\npassing an ex parte ad interim order.  The balance of convenience also lies in\nfavour of passing an ex parte ad interim order since any prior notice may defeat\nthe purpose of passing the interim order and may render the interim order\nnugatory accordingly.\nThere shall be an order of injunction restraining the respondent, its men,\nservants, agents and assigns from infringing the petitioner’s registered trademark\n“Khadim’s” by manufacturing and/or selling and/or otherwise dealing in\nproducts bearing the impugned mark “Khadam’s” / “Khadams”.  There shall also\nbe an order in terms of prayer (b).\n3\nMr. Dipan Sarkar, Bar Library Club, is appointed as a Special Officer with\na direction to make an inventory and to take possession of all infringing goods\nand/or products including signage/hoarding, advertisements and any other\nmaterials whatsoever in the possession, custody and control of the respondent,\nor its men, servants or staff or employees or agents or dealers or distributors or\nretailers or franchisees or assigns and keep the seized products at a place to be\nprovided by the petitioner until further orders.\nThe Special Officer shall be entitled to a final remuneration of 2000 GMs.\nto be paid by the petitioner.  The petitioner shall communicate this order along\nwith the copy of the plaint and the petition upon the respondent within three\nworking days from date failing which the interim order shall stand vacated.\nThe matter is made returnable on 27th February, 2019.\n                                   (SOUMEN SEN, J.)\nsp/\n",

The applicants shall comply with the order dated 10th January, 2019 within\n2\none week from date, failing which this Court may be constrained to issue contempt\nrule against the applicants.  It is expected that the respondent shall not misbehave\nwith the children of the deceased born out of the first marriage.\nThe application is, accordingly, disposed of.\n                                   (SOUMEN SEN, J.)\nB.Pal\n",

DILIP CHOUDHURY\n-VS-\nPRATISHRUTI PROJECTS LIMITED & ORS.\n    BEFORE:\n    The Hon'ble JUSTICE MOUSHUMI BHATTACHARYA\n    Date : 1st February, 2019.\n  Appearance\nMr. S.P. Sarkar,Sr. Adv.\nMr. A.K. Awasthi, Adv.\nMr. Adil Rashid, Adv.\n… for the plaintiff\nMr. Shuvasish Sengupta, Adv.\nMr. Sarosij Dasgupta, Adv.\nMr. S. Banerjee, Adv.\nMr. S. Das, Adv.\n… for the defendant no. 3 and 4\n    The Court : This is an application filed on behalf of the defendant no.3 for\nextension of time to file the written statement.\n   The facts as stated in the application are that the plaintiff filed a suit for\nrecovery of money in 2015 claiming a decree against the defendant nos.1 to 8\n2\ntogether with an enquiry for damages. The writ of summons was served on the\ndefendant no.3 in March, 2015.\n    The defendant no.3/applicant filed an application in 2016 for dismissal of\nthe suit in which, by an order dated 7th June, 2016, the suit was directed not to\nbe transferred to the undefended list. The plaintiff applied for judgement on\nadmission in the meantime and by an order dated 26th July, 2016, the suit was\ndecreed in favour of the plaintiff and against the defendants.  An appeal preferred\nfrom the decree by the defendant no.3 was allowed by an order dated 22nd\nAugust, 2017 by a Division Bench of this Court by which, inter alia, the suit was\ndirected to be placed before an appropriate Bench for disposal.  Pursuant to such\norder, the suit was accordingly placed before a learned Single Judge.  By an order\ndated 24th October, 2017, on the request of counsel appearing for the defendant,\nthe defendant nos.3 and 4 were granted time to seek a clarification from the\nDivision Bench pertaining to the fate of the application filed for dismissal of the\nsuit being GA No. 196 of 2016. This clarification was apparently required since\nthe order passed by the Division Bench on 22nd August, 2017 did not mention\nthe application filed by the defendants  for dismissal of the suit.\n      The instant application for extension of time to file the written statement\nwas filed in January, 2018. It should be mentioned that by an order dated 3rd\nJuly, 2018 passed by this Court, the prayer of the defendant no. 5 for extension\nof time to file the written statement was allowed. One of the grounds mentioned\nin the said order for allowing the prayer of the defendant no. 5 is that the hearing\nof the suit has not commenced and no order for inspection and discovery of\n3\ndocuments has been made. The defendant no. 5 was permitted to file written\nstatement upon payment of costs.\nMr. Suvasish Sengupta and Mr. Sarasij Dasgupta, learned counsel\nappearing for the defendant no. 3 in the instant application, submits that his\nclient wishes to contest the suit and take all points of defence at the time of trial\nwhich can only be done if the defendant no. 3 is allowed to file its written\nstatement. It appears however that the only ground mentioned in the application\nis that the defendant no. 3 did not file the written statement by reason of the\norder dated 7th June, 2016 by which the suit was directed not to be transferred\nto the undefended list.\nMr. Shyam Sarkar, learned senior counsel for the plaintiff who is opposing\nthe instant applicant, relies on the Calcutta Amendment to Order VIII Rule 1 of\nThe Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 which has added two further provisos for\nextending the time beyond 90 days and further, beyond 120 days subject to the\nconditions specified which a defendant has to prove to the satisfaction of the\ncourt. According to counsel, both the extended period of 90 days and the final\nextension of 120 days from the service of summons have long gone and the\ndefendant has offered no explanation which would save it from the rigours of\nOrder VIII.  In other words the defendant no.3 has failed to satisfy the court that\nit was prevented from filing the written statement either by reason of unforeseen\ncircumstances or those beyond his control. It is submitted that the grounds\npleaded relate to a period after the order passed by the Division Bench on 22nd\n4\nAugust,2017 instead of the period immediately following service of the writ of\nsummons.\nIn answer to the above contentions, learned counsel for the defendant no.\n3/applicant relies on Salem Advocate Bar Association,T.N. vs. Union of India\nreported in (2005) 6 SCC 344 where it was held, inter alia, that the word “shall” in\nOrder VIII Rule 1 will have to be construed in the context of the intention of the\nlegislature which is to advance the cause of justice and not to defeat it. It was\nalso held in the said decision that the court has the power to make any order as\nit deems fit even after expiry of the time period provided under Order VIII Rule 1.\nCounsel further submits that the “unforeseen circumstances” under the first\nproviso of the Calcutta Amendment would be the decree passed against the\ndefendant on 26th April, 2016 and that there was no scope of filing a written\nstatement until the appeal (preferred by the defendant no. 3 from the decree) was\ndisposed of by the Appeal Court in August  2017.\nHaving heard counsel appearing for the defendant no. 3 and the plaintiff, it\nis evident that the defendant no. 3 is well outside the time limits prescribed\nunder Order VIII Rule 1 and the Calcutta amendment but it is equally true that\nthe defendant no. 3 contested the proceedings culminating in the decree passed\nagainst it in July, 2016 and thereafter in the appeal preferred by it which was\ndisposed of in August, 2017.  Subsequent thereto, the defendant also sought a\nclarification in relation to the application filed by it for dismissal of the suit being\nGA No. 196 of 2016, before a learned single Judge in October 2017 and was\n5\ngranted time to seek clarification from the appeal court. The instant application\nwas filed within three months thereafter.\nThe sequence of events narrated in the application makes it clear that the\ndefendant no. 3 has all along contested the suit and participated in the\nproceedings for dismissal of the suit and for challenging the decree. The order of\nthe Division Bench demonstrates that the entire matter was considered on merits\nupon which the decree was set aside and the suit was directed to be disposed of\non merits. The defendant no. 3, in fact, continued to demonstrate its intention of\ncontesting the suit at least till the end of October 2017 as would be evident from\nthe order passed by the learned Judge on 24th October 2017. Although, the\nmaximum period of 120 days from the date of service of the writ of summons on\nthe defendant no. 3 expired some time in July, 2015, what is material in the\npresent factual context is that the defendant filed for dismissal of the suit before\nit suffered the decree dated 26th July, 2016 which was challenged by the\ndefendant. The words used in the two added provisos in the Calcutta Amendment\nto Order VIII Rule 1 can be construed to mean that a defendant is given at least\ntwo windows(under exceptional circumstances) from the date of service of the\nsummons to explain the delay in filing the written statement. Strict guidelines\nhave been provided for under the added provisos within which a defendant has to\nprove its bona fides to the satisfaction of court that the defendant indeed was\nprevented from complying with the prescribed time-lines for circumstances\nbeyond its control (the Second Proviso under the Calcutta Amendment). The\n“unforeseen circumstances” and “the circumstances beyond his control” would,\n6\nin the facts of this case, be the decree and the steps taken thereafter by the\ndefendant to challenge such decree and to contest the suit.\nThe ratio of the decision in Salem Advocates namely that Order VIII Rule 1\nhas to advance the cause of justice is the guiding light for most rules of\nprocedure where a defendant should not be deprived of the opportunity to\npresent its defence. Advancing the cause of justice would naturally include the\nrights of a litigant to contest a suit on merits and not be prevented by the rules of\nprocedure from doing so. This would particularly be true of a litigant who has\nproved its diligence in participating in the proceedings instead of playing truant\ntill the windows of opportunity literally shut the defendant out for all times to\ncome. It should also be stated that the language used in Order VIII Rule 1\nsuggests an inactive, lax defendant; a party who refuses to act despite the law\nproviding three stages for filing its defence. Such is not the case here.\nThe order passed by this Court on 3rd July, 2018 would also be of some\nrelevance since another defendant (No.5) in the present suit has been allowed\nextension of time to file its written statement upon payment of costs. It is also\ncorrect that there has not been any further development in the suit including\ncompletion of  inspection and discovery. Therefore, if the present applicant is\nallowed to file its written statement, the plaintiff will not suffer any particular\nprejudice. However, given the fact that substantial time has passed from the date\nwithin which the defendant no.3 ought to have filed its written statement, it is\nonly fit that costs are imposed on the defendant no.3.\n7\n GA 734 of 2018 is accordingly allowed in terms of prayer (b).  Prayer (a)\nhas already been allowed by an earlier order dated 3rd May, 2018.\nThe defendant no.3 will be permitted to file its written statement within two\nweeks from date subject to costs assessed at Rs. 20,000 to be paid to\nRamkrishna Mission Jana Shiksha Parishad within a fortnight from date.\n(MOUSHUMI BHATTACHARYA,J.)\nRS/s.chandra/sp3\n",

It was\nalso held in the said decision that the court has the power to make any order as\nit deems fit even after expiry of the time period provided under Order VIII Rule 1.\nCounsel further submits that the “unforeseen circumstances” under the first\nproviso of the Calcutta Amendment would be the decree passed against the\ndefendant on 26th April, 2016 and that there was no scope of filing a written\nstatement until the appeal (preferred by the defendant no. 4 from the decree) was\ndisposed of by the Appeal Court in August  2017.\nHaving heard counsel appearing for the defendant no. 4 and the plaintiff, it\nis evident that the defendant no. 4 is well outside the time limits prescribed\nunder Order VIII Rule 1 and the Calcutta amendment but it is equally true that\nthe defendant no. 4 contested the proceedings culminating in the decree passed\nagainst it in July, 2016 and thereafter in the appeal preferred by it which was\ndisposed of in August, 2017.  Subsequent thereto, the defendant also sought a\nclarification in relation to the application filed by it for dismissal of the suit being\nGA No. 196 of 2016, before a learned single Judge in October 2017 and was\n5\ngranted time to seek clarification from the appeal court. The instant application\nwas filed within three months thereafter.\nThe sequence of events narrated in the application makes it clear that the\ndefendant no. 4 has all along contested the suit and participated in the\nproceedings for dismissal of the suit and for challenging the decree. The order of\nthe Division Bench demonstrates that the entire matter was considered on merits\nupon which the decree was set aside and the suit was directed to be disposed of\non merits. The defendant no. 4, in fact, continued to demonstrate its intention of\ncontesting the suit at least till the end of October 2017 as would be evident from\nthe order passed by the learned Judge on 24th October, 2017. Although, the\nmaximum period of 120 days from the date of service of the writ of summons on\nthe defendant no. 4 expired some time in the end of August, 2015, what is\nmaterial in the present factual context is that the defendant filed for dismissal of\nthe suit before it suffered the decree dated 26th July, 2016 which was challenged\nby the defendant. The words used in the two added provisos in the Calcutta\nAmendment to Order VIII Rule 1 can be construed to mean that a defendant is\ngiven at least two windows (under exceptional circumstances) from the date of\nservice of the summons to explain the delay in filing the written statement. Strict\nguidelines have been provided for under the added provisos within which a\ndefendant has to prove its bona fides to the satisfaction of court that the\ndefendant indeed was prevented from complying with the prescribed time-lines\nfor circumstances beyond its control (the Second Proviso under the Calcutta\nAmendment). The “unforeseen circumstances” and “the circumstances beyond\n6\nhis control” would, in the facts of this case, be the decree and the steps taken\nthereafter by the defendant to challenge such decree and to contest the suit.\nThe ratio of the decision in Salem Advocates namely that Order VIII Rule 1\nhas to advance the cause of justice is the guiding light for most rules of\nprocedure where a defendant should not be deprived of the opportunity to\npresent its defence. Advancing the cause of justice would naturally include the\nrights of a litigant to contest a suit on merits and not be prevented by the rules of\nprocedure from doing so. This would particularly be true of a litigant who has\nproved its diligence in participating in the proceedings instead of playing truant\ntill the windows of opportunity literally shut the defendant out for all times to\ncome. It should also be stated that the language used in Order VIII Rule 1\nsuggests an inactive, lax defendant; a party who refuses to act despite the law\nproviding three stages for filing its defence. Such is not the case here.\nThe order passed by this Court on 3rd July, 2018 would also be of some\nrelevance since another defendant (No.5) in the present suit has been allowed\nextension of time to file its written statement upon payment of costs. It is also\ncorrect that there has not been any further development in the suit including\ncompletion of  inspection and discovery. Therefore, if the present applicant is\nallowed to file its written statement, the plaintiff will not suffer any particular\nprejudice. However, given the fact that substantial time has passed from the date\nwithin which the defendant no.4 ought to have filed its written statement, it is\nonly fit that costs are imposed on the defendant no.4.\n7\n GA 735 of 2018 is accordingly allowed in terms of prayer (b).  Prayer (a)\nhas already been allowed by an earlier order dated 3rd May, 2018.\nThe defendant no.4 will be permitted to file its written statement within two\nweeks from date subject to costs assessed at Rs. 10,000 to be paid to\nRamkrishna Mission Jana Shiksha Parishad within a fortnight from date.\n(MOUSHUMI BHATTACHARYA,J.)\nRS/s.chandra/sp3\n",

Ltd. reported in\n(2018 SCC Online SC 1045 the present application stands\nrejected.\n                           (ASHIS KUMAR CHAKRABORTY, J.)\nmg\n3\n",

The consequence of non-appointment of the \n\nPresenting  Officer  in  the disciplinary/departmental  inquiry  had already \n\nbeen  discussed  and  decided  finally  by  this  Court  as  well  as  the  Apex \n\nCourt that the disciplinary proceeding/departmental inquiry without the \n\nPresenting  Officer  is  illegal.  This  Court  as  well  as  Apex  Court  also \n\ndecided  in  a  number  of  cases  that  in  the  case  departmental  inquiry  is \n\nfound to be illegal  because of certain defects such as non-appointment \n\nof Presenting Officer, de-novo inquiry should be started from the stage \n\nwhere the illegality had been crept in. \n\n \n\n[4] \n\n \n\nFor  the  foregoing  facts,  the  impugned  orders  dated \n\n15.01.2001,  09.05.2001  and  18.05.2001  so  far  as  the  present  writ \n\npetitioners  are  concerned,  are  hereby  set  aside  and  a  fresh  de-novo \n\ninquiry  shall  be  started  from  the  stage  of  appointment  of  Presenting \n\nOfficer.  \n\n [5] \n\n \n\nIt is made clear that in case after completion of the present \n\ninquiry,  the  charges  levelled  against  the  petitioner  are  found  proved, \n\nany  penalty  to  be  imposed  against  the  petitioners  should  be  in \n\n\fconsideration  of \n\nthe  quantum  of  punishment \n\nimposed  by \n\nthe \n\ndisciplinary authority in the earlier similar cases. \n\n \n\n[6] \n\n \n\nWith the above direction, this misc. application is allowed. \n\nSince  the  de-novo  inquiry  is  to  be  started  for  the  instance  which \n\nhappened  many  years  ago,  the  de-novo  inquiry  should  be  completed \n\nwithin  a  period  of  three  months  from  the  date  of  receipt  of  a  certified \n\ncopy of this order. \n\nW.P.(C) No. 1085 of 2001 is also allowed accordingly. \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nJUDGE \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nbipin \n\n \n\n\f",

He  joined  service  on \n02.07.1990. \n2\n2. According to the petitioner, the post of Bill Collector and Junior \nAssistant are interchangeable and carries the same scale of pay. He is \ncurrently  working  as  Junior  Assistant  in  the  Chittapalayam  Town \nPanchayat. The next promotion is to the post of Executive Officer Grade \nII. In the combined seniority list of Junior Assistant/Bill Collector/Typist as \non 01.01.2004, his name finds place at Serial No.69.\n3. However, his name was not included in the panel for promotion \nto the post of Executive Officer Grade II on the ground that his services \nwere  not  regularized  for  want  of  concurrence  from Tamil  Nadu  Public \nService Commission (for short TNPSC) as the post in which he was initially \nappointed viz.,  Bill  Collector  is  a  Provincialised post  coming within  the \npurview of TNPSC, whereas, the names of his juniors find place in the said \nlist.\n4. While so, the second respondent has sent a proposal to the 1st \nrespondent to regularize the service of the petitioner as Bill Collector from \nthe date of his initial appointment. However, till date no action is taken by \nthe respondents.  Hence, the petitioner has filed this writ petition, seeking \ndirection  to  the  respondents  1 and 2  to  regularize  his  services  as  Bill \nCollector/Junior  Assistant  from  the  date  of  his  initial  appointment  and \nconsequently direct the respondents to promote him as Executive Officer \nGrade II on par with his juniors.\n3\n5.

This  Court  in  W.P.No.19932  of  2008  dated  15.06.2011  while \ninterpreting the above said Government Order has directed the authorities \nto regularize the service of the person who was appointed as Sweeper as \nJunior  Assistant  from  the  date  of  his  initial  appointment  with  all \nconsequential benefits.  It was made clear that the posts mentioned in the \nGovernment Order viz., Night Watchman, Office Assistant, Record Clerk \nare only indicative in nature and does not exclude the other lower posts.\n7. The learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that in \nidentical  cases,  the  respondents  had  issued  the  following  Government \nOrders  regularising the service of  persons appointed on compassionate \nground as Junior Assistant/Bill Collector:-\ni) G.O.Ms.No.407 (MAWS Department) dated 02.08.2001\nii)G.O.Ms.No.146 (MAWS Department) dated 16.04.2002\niii)G.O.Ms.No.59 (MAWS Department) dated 27.08.2004\niv)G.O.Ms.No.34 (MAWS Department) dated 13.12.2006\n8.

The petitioner claims himself to be a social activist and a son \nof  a  freedom fighter  espousing  the  causes  of  general  public,  poor \nagriculturists, Tribals and others living in and around the region of the \nKodaikanal Hills.  The petitioner would further state that the seventh \nrespondent  is  abusing  and  misusing  his  official  position  and  has \nencroached vast extent of Forest land by engaging his henchman.  It is \nstated  that  the  seventh  respondent  and  his  henchman  have \nencroached the lands comprised in Survey No.671/2, Poolathur village \nand  its  adjoining  Survey  numbers  measuring  about  1  acre  and  30 \ncents  and in  the said  land,  there  is  a  monumental  structure  called \n\"Mirror Palace\" (fz;zho khspif).  It is further stated that such of those \npersons,  who  have  voiced  against  the  activities  of  the  seventh \n4\nrespondent were subjected to torture and harassment.  It is further \nstated that the seventh respondent has been carrying on agricultural \nactivities  in  the  said  land  by  planting  coffee,  orange  and  other \ncommercial  crops.  It  is  further  submitted  that  when  the  petitioner \npointed out the illegalities committed by the seventh respondent, the \nseventh  respondent  using  his  official  power,  transferred  the \npetitioner's wife, who was working as a Teacher.   Further, it is stated \nthat the structure known as \"Mirror  Palace\" was demolished by the \nseventh respondent.  Therefore, according to the petitioner, the matter \nrequires  to  be  probed thoroughly  for  which  purpose,  the  petitioner \nstates that he had submitted a representation on 07.12.2012 and filed \nthis writ petition for the aforementioned relief.\n3.  The District  Collector,  sixth respondent  has filed  a counter \naffidavit stating that the land comprised in Survey No.671/2, is not a \nReserve  Forest  Land,  but  as  per  the  revenue  records,  it  is  a \nGovernment  Poromboke  land  under  the  control  of  the  revenue \ndepartment.  It is further submitted that once upon a time, there was \na building in the said land, which is now in a dilapidated condition and \nonly half of the walls are seen amidst the bushes and this building is \nnoted as \"Forest Bungalow\" in the \"A\" Register.  It is further stated \n5\nthat one Mr.T.A.Ramasamy encroached the said land and notice under \nSection 7 of the Tamil Nadu Land Encroachment Act was issued to him \nduring 1988.  It is further submitted that no such notice was issued to \nthe seventh respondent.  That the seventh respondent is owning lands \nin Survey No.670, which is adjoining to the Government Poromboke \nland  in  Survey  No.671/2  and  the  seventh  respondent  has  not \nencroached the said Government Poromboke land.  It is further stated \nthat the transfer of the petitioner's wife was purely on administrative \ngrounds, as the public of the village submitted a complaint before the \nsixth respondent and on enquiry, it revealed that the petitioner's wife \nwas using unparliamentary language against the children and keeping \nin  view of  the  public  interest,  the  petitioner's  wife  was  transferred \npurely  on  administrative  ground  to  school  in  Kumbaraiyur  village, \nwhich is very near to the school, where she was working.  Further, it is \nsubmitted that the writ petition is not a Public Interest Litigation, but a \nprivate interest litigation. \n4. The seventh respondent in his counter affidavit while denying \nand disputing the allegations made by the petitioner, has contended \nthat the writ petition styled as a Public Interest Litigation is a thorough \nmisuse of power and process of this Court.  It is further contended that \n6\nthe seventh respondent and the writ petitioner belonged to the same \nvillage and have known each other since childhood.  It is further stated \nthat the land in Survey No.670 is the ancestral property of the seventh \nrespondent, presently in his occupation and he has disclosed this in his \nproperty statement submitted to the Government.  Survey No.671/2 is \nlocated adjacent to the seventh respondent's ancestral property and \nthe lands in Survey Nos.671/1 and 671/2 provides a pathway to reach \nthe  seventh  respondent's  patta  land  in  Survey  No.670  and  such \npathway has been in existence from time immemorial.  It  is  further \nstated that one T.A.R.Kamatchi, son of T.A.Ramasamy Chettiar and his \nfamily members were in possession and enjoyment of a major portion \nof the land to an extent of 1 acre and 85 cents for several years and \nthe revenue records pertaining to those lands establish that Survey \nNo.671/2,  is  a  \"Paathai  Poromboke\"  and  not  a  Reserve  Forest  as \nalleged  by  the  petitioner.   It  is  further  stated  that  the  said \nT.A.Ramasamy  have  recently  sold  the  land  to  one  Mr.K.Senthil \nMurugan, who also belongs to a same village.  The allegation that the \npetitioner  demolished  the  Mirror  Palace  is  false.   The  seventh \nrespondent has further stated that the petitioner is not a social activist, \nbut  a  person  engaged  in  Katta  Panchayat  and  there  are  several \nallegations against the petitioner and the people of the village have \n7\nalso  given  complaints.   It  is  further  alleged  that  the  petitioner  is \nindirectly attempting to grab a valuable property of the Primary Health \nCentre of Poolathur village and the public have made complaint to the \nauthorities  in  this  regard.   Since no action was taken, the seventh \nrespondent sent a letter to the Secretary to the Government to protect \nthe said property.

Whether on the facts and circumstances of the \ncase, the Tribunal was correct in holding that the petitioner \nhas  not  proved  with  records  that  they  have  sold  only \nagricultural produce when the petitioner has produced the \ndocuments  before  the  Appellate  Authority  in  proof  of \nexpenses incurred for producing shade trees?\n2.  Whether the Tribunal was correct in holding that \nthe petitioner has not sold the Standing Trees when the \nAppellate  Authority  himself  has  observed  that  the \nappellants  have  proved  with  accounts  with  reference  to \nexpenses  incurred  for  purchase  of  seeds,  nursery \ndevelopment, employing human labour for lopping shade \ntrees and the same was sold?\n3.  Whether the Tribunal was correct in holding that \nin the absence of details of nature of sales the standing \ntrees are not eligible for exemption, when the Hon'ble High \nCourt has held in the decision reported in 45 STC page 10 \nthat for enabling convenient transportation of the trees if \nthat  are  sized  and  cut  and  sold  still  it  is  eligible  for \nexemption as Agricultural produce?\n4. Whether  the Tribunal was correct  in disallowing \n3\nthe exemption when for  earlier  year the exemption was \nallowed holding that the petitioner have grown shade trees \nas  part  and  parcel  of  their  agricultural  process  of \ndeveloping  and  maintaining  the  tea  plantation  and  thus \ntheir standing shade trees are only agricultural produce to \nbe  exempted  from  tax  and  the  same  process  was \ncontinued for the year in dispute?\n2.  The assessee is a manufacturer and dealer in Tea.  In respect \nof the tea plantation run by the assessee, they have planted shade \ntrees for providing shade to the tea crops.  After obtaining permission \nfrom  the  Forest  Department,  the  assessee  cut  and  reused  certain \nshade trees; the sale of which was exempt as agricultural produce. \nHowever, the Assessing Officer treated it as timber assessable at 10%. \n3. Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  the  Assessing  Officer,  the \nassessee went on appeal before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner, \nwho pointed out that though the assessee had proved by furnishing \nthe accounts  relating to the expenses on seeds purchases,  nursery \ndevelopment,  employing  human  labour  for  maintaining  the  shade \ntrees, they failed to produce the sale invoices and agreement to show \nthe nature of transaction relating to the sale of shade trees.  Thus in \nthe absence of the above details, the First Appellate Authority rejected \n4\nthe assessee's claim that the standing shade trees sold by them are \nagricultural produce eligible for exemption. As  against  the  said \norder,  the assessee went on appeal  before  the Sales Tax Appellate \nTribunal, which confirmed the order of the First Appellate Authority.  \n4.  Aggrieved by the dismissal of the appeal by the Sales Tax \nAppellate Tribunal, the assessee is before this court in this revision.\n5. Learned counsel for the petitioner placed before us the cutting \norder issued by the Coimbatore District Forest Officer on the shade \ntrees planted by the petitioner.  Considering the fact that the removal \nof the Standing shade trees can be done only with the permission of \nthe Forest Department, the learned counsel for the petitioner submits \nthat the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal failed to advert to the necessary \ndocuments placed before the Tribunal for granting the relief.\n6.  We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well \nas  the  learned  Government  Advocate  (Taxes)  and  perused  the \ndocuments.\n7.  Considering the nature of the business run by the assessee, \n5\nand the fact  that in a tea plantation, maintaining of shade trees is a \nnormal incident, the only question that has to be considered by us is as \nto  whether  the  sale  of  trees  are   cut  under  orders  of  the  Forest \nDepartment are timber or not?\n8.  The Tribunal pointed out that the assessee had not produced \nany details regarding the nature of sales of the cut trees before the \nauthorities below and that they had not proved that what was sold was \nagricultural produce.  \n9.   We  find  from  the  order  of  the  Appellate  Assistant \nCommissioner  that  though  he  was  convinced  of  the  expenditure \nincurred  for  reusing  the  trees,  there  was  no  material  produced  to \nprove that standing trees were cut and sold.\n10.  Learned counsel pointed out that the trees could be cut and \nreused only under the order of the Forest Department and that cutting \npermission  were  obtained  from  the  Forest  Department.   The \nagreement with S.Sivanandam, 16/8, V.H.Road, Pollachi 642 001 for \nthe sale and cutting of the trees could not be produced at the time of \nhearing as the person in charge had suddenly left the services of the \n6\nassessee.    In  the  circumstances,  the  petitioner  prayed  that  the \nassessment be set aside for fresh consideration.\n11.  Considering the  the facts placed before this court and more \nso in view of the finding given by the First Appellate Court in para 10 \nof its order, the proper course herein is to set aside the order of the \nSales Tax Appellate Tribunal and restore the matter to the file of the \nAssessing  Officer   to  consider  the  claim of  the  assessee  in  proper \nperspective in the light of the materials produced.   The assessee is \ndirected to place all necessary materials that are in their possession, \nas far as cutting of trees are concerned and in support of the claim for \nexemption.  After  hearing the petitioner,  the Assessing Officer  may \npass the order in accordance with law.\n12.  In the result,  Tax Case (Revision) No.30 of 2012 stands \ndisposed of on the above terms.  No costs.\n  (C.V.,J)        (K.B.K.V.,J)\n   23.08.2013\nIndex:Yes/No\nInternet:Yes/No\nvj2\n7\nCHITRA VENKATARAMAN, J.\nand\n K.B.K.VASUKI, J.\nvj2\nTo\n1.

By the Deputy Commissioner\n(Commercial Taxes)\nSalem Division, Salem  ...Petitioner in all the\n        above TC(R)\n-vs-\nTvl.S.S.M.Processing Mills\n90,Idappadi Road,Komarapalayam                 ...Respondent \n         in all the above TC(R)\nTax Case Revisions filed under Section 38 of TNGST Act, 1959 to \nrevise  the  order  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Sales  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal, \nAdditional  Bench,  Coimbatore  dated  07.05.2003  passed  in \nCTA.Nos.274 of 2000, 252/2001 and 72/2001 respectively.\nFor petitioner : Mr.Jayapratap\nGovt.Advocate (Taxes)\nFor respondent           :        Mr.Ravi Raja\n   COMMON ORDER\n(The Order of the Court was made by\nCHITRA VENKATARAMAN, J.)\nThe Revenue is on revision as against the order of the Sales Tax \nAppellate Tribunal relating to the assessment years 1989-90, 1994-95 \n2\nand 1987-88 respectively raising the following questions of law :-\n\"1. Whether in the facts and circumstances of the case, \nthe  Tribunal  has  failed  to  consider  that  in  dyeing  works \ncontract,  the  goods  to  be  incorporated  may  either  be  as \ngoods  or  in  some  other  form  similar  to  the  accretion  or \noccasions due to the application of dyes and chemicals ?\n2. Whether the Tribunal has failed to distinguish dyes \nand chemicals from that of consumables like fuel or welding \nelectrodes,  which  are  exhausted  or  disappeared  after  the \nwork executed ?\"\n2.  Since all  the Tax Cases (Revision)  are  related to the very \nsame assessee and the common questions of law arise, it is suffice to \nrefer the general facts as are available.  \n3. The assessee herein is carrying on business in bleaching and \ndyeing  of  fabrics.   The  chemicals  involved  therein  were  purchased \noutside the State. On the question of liability on the works contract \nexecuted under the Sales Tax Act as the deemed sale, the Sales Tax \nAppellate Tribunal held that the nature of transaction in the dyeing \ncontract  or  in  bleaching  was  not  \"transfer  of  property\"  or  \"sale\" \nsimplicitor; consequently, levy of sales tax treating it as deemed sale \ndid  not  arise.   Aggrieved  by  the  order  passed  by  the  Sales  Tax \nAppellate Tribunal, the present Tax Case Revisions are preferred by \n3\nthe Revenue.  \n4. As far as dyeing contract is concerned, both sides agree that \nthe said issue is covered by the unreported decision of this Court dated \n1.7.2011 passed in T.C.(R) Nos. 842, 817, 818, 819 to 823, 826, 841, \n843, 849,  850, 870, 982, 987,   990, 1036, 1038 and 1040 of 2006, \nwherein,  this  Court  followed  the  decisions  reported  in  RAINBOW \nCOLOUR LAB AND ANOTHER v.  STATE OF MADHYA PRADESH \nAND  OTHER  [2000]  118  STC  9  and ASSOCIATED  CEMENT \nCOMPANIES LIMITED v. COMMISSIONER OF CUSTOMS [2001] \n124 STC 59, and held that the chemicals used in the execution of \nworks contract on the dyeing of cloth attracted sales tax. \n5. As far as bleaching of the grey cloth as job work done by the \nassessee herein is concerned, in the decision reported in (2003) 129 \nSTC  167  in  the  case  of (Apparels  and  Handloom  Exporters \nAssociation and others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others), this \nCourt  considered  the  scope  of  expression  \"whether  as  goods  or  in \nsome other form\" in Section 3-B of the Tamil Nadu General Sales Tax \nAct,  1959  (hereinafter  called  as  the  \"Act)  which  are  found  in \nparenthesis in  Article  366(29-A) and pointed out that the object  of \n4\namendment in Article 366 (29-A) of the Constitution was to bring to \ntax the items, which otherwise could not have been brought to tax, \nand it was not meant to be a sieve through which goods liable to be \ntaxed are  allowed to escape tax.  This  Court  further  pointed out  in \nparagraph 13 as under:-\n\"13.  The  change  in  the  form referred  to  in \narticle 366(29-A) of the Constitution is not change \nin  the  form  of  the  goods  to  other  commercially \ndistinct  and  taxable  goods.   The  change  of  form \nreferred  to  therein,  is  the  change  of  goods  into \nanother form which by itself would not have been \ntaxable but for the use of that expression in article \n366(29-A).\"\nThus, in the context of expression used in \" a tax on the transfer of \nproperty in goods (whether as goods or in some other form) involved \nin  the  execution  of  a  works  contract\",  this  Court  held  that  the \nprovisions of the Sales Tax Act stood attracted.  \n6. In the decision reported in (2011) 39 VST 434 (Ker) (FB) \nin  the  case  of (Enviro  Chemicals  Vs.  State  of  Kerala),  the  Full \nBench of the Kerala High Court considered the case similar to the one \nin  hand.   The  facts  were  that  the  petitioner/assessee  developed  a \nchemical product by name \"envirofloc\",  used as a chemical for effluent \n5\ntreatment.  The assessee carried out pollution control treatment for \nMadura Coats Limited,  Koratty in the manufacture of  yarn.   In the \nprocess  of  such  treatment,  the  assessee  applied  the  chemical \nenvirofloc and in that it either got used up in the treatment of effluent \nwater  by neutralising colour,  odour  etc..   On the question whether \nthere was sale of materials involved in the execution of works contract \nin the services rendered in the form of chemical treatment of effluent \nwater at the factory of customer, the Full Bench of the Kerala High \ncourt held that the moment, the chemicals were put into effluent plant \nby the petitioner, the property in the goods passed on to the customer \nand its subsequent consumption was after sale.  This did not detract \nfrom the factum of sale and consequently, the exigibility to tax was \nheld as unquestionable.  Thus, there was sale of chemical involved in \nthe execution of works contract.  On this, the Full Bench of Kerala High \nCourt upheld the decision of the Assessing Officer and held that the \nassessee was liable to be assessed under the provisions of the Sales \nTax Act.  The Kerala High Court however, held that even after insertion \nof Article 366 (29A), under the 46th Amendment to the Constitution, \nthere cannot be any sales tax on a works contract per se; there must \nbe transfer of property in goods, as goods or in any other form. \n6\n7. We are in respectful agreement with the decision of the Full \nBench of the Kerala High Court.  Applying this decision and read in the \ncontext of the decision of this Court reported in (2003) 129 STC 167 \nin  the  case  of (Apparels  and Handloom Exporters  Association \nand others Vs. State of Tamil Nadu and others), we do not find \nany justifiable ground to uphold the order of the Sales Tax Appellate \nTribunal to hold that the transaction are not liable to tax.  \n8. The fact that the chemicals used for bleaching is washed away \nin the process, by itself, would not be a justifiable ground to accept the \ncase of the assessee that there was no transfer  of property of any \ngoods.   The  very  fact  of  the  yarn  being  bleached  by  a  chemical \nprocess, by applying the chemical, will clearly point out that there is \ntransfer of property of the chemical, hence, bleaching contract attracts \nsales tax as in the case of dyeing contract, when the chemicals are \npurchased from outside the state.  Consequently, this Court allow the \nTax Case (Revisions) filed by the State.\n9.  As  far  as  levy  of  penalty  is  concerned,  we  cancel  levy  of \npenalty in all the above Tax Cases (Revision) following the unreported \n7\ndecision  of  this  Court  dated  24.07.2013  passed  in  Tax  Case \n(Revision)No.523 of 2006 (The State of Tamil Nadu,rep. By the Deputy \nCommissioner,  (Commercial  Taxes),  Salem  Division,  Salem   vs. \nTvl.Jansons  Textile  Processors,  No.68/A1,  Namakkal  Road, \nTiruchengode, since there was no suppression of sale in the turnover \nand  that  the  claim  of  the  assessee  was  rejected  only  on  the \ninterpretation placed on Section 3B of the Act.\n10. In the result, the Tax Case (Revisions) are ordered on the \nabove terms.

The Trial Court decreed \nthe suit directing the appellants to hand over possession \nof the suit property to the first respondent/plaintiff and \nto  pay  a  sum  of  Rs.10,000/=  towards  compensation  for \ndemolishing  the  old  structure  and  the  plaintiff  has  to \napply  separately  for  working  out  his  mesne  profit. \nAggrieved by the same, this appeal is filed.  \n3. The case of the plaintiff as seen from the plaint \nis as follows:-\nThe  suit  property  and  the  larger  extent  originally \nbelonged to one Pakkiri Mohideen Rowther and he settled the \nentire  house  property  and  its  backyard  to  his  relations \nunder a registered Inam Sasanam dated 13.7.1926 in favour \nof of Habeeb Mohamed, Shaik Mohamed, Fathima Bivi and their \nmother Ayisa Bivi and after the death of Ayisa Bivi, the \naforesaid  three  persons  effected  a  partition  among \nthemselves under a registered partition deed dated 3.6.1933 \n3\nand  divided  the  property  into  three  portions  and  'C' \nportion mentioned in the partition deed was allotted to the \nshare of  Fathima Beevi and 'A' schedule was allotted to \nthe share of  Habeeb Mohamed and 'B' schedule was allotted \nto Shaik  Mohamed.  The plaintiff is the son of Fathima \nBeevi  and  the  first  defendant  is  the  widow  of  Habeeb \nMohamed and the second defendant is his son. As per the \npartition deed, each party was enjoying their portion and \nHabeeb Mohamed sold the 'A' schedule property he got under \nthe  partition  to  Sheik  Mohamed  on  8.11.1947  and  he  re-\npurchased the same on 22.12.1954. After the lifetime of his \nmother, the plaintiff was enjoying the property and as the \nplaintiff was doing business in foreign country, he kept \nthe property locked.  The defendants attempted to purchase \nthe property of the plaintiff as well as the share of other \nsharer Sheik Mohammed.  Taking advantage of the absence of \nthe plaintiff, the defendants demolished the old building \nand  started  construction  in  the  entire  property  and \ntherefore, the suit was filed for recovery of possession of \nremoval of superstructure put up by the defendants in the \nproperty belonged to the plaintiff. \n4.  The  defendants  filed  a  statement  admitting  the \npartition deed dated 3.6.1933.  It is further stated that \n4\nHabeeb Mohamed, husband of the first defendant purchased \nthe share of the plaintiff's mother in the suit property \nand also purchased the share of Sheik Mohammed and both the \npurchases were under oral sale and for consideration less \nthan  Rs.100/=  and  thereafter,  Habeeb  Mohamed  was  in \nenjoyment  of  the  entire  property  and  mutation  was  also \neffected in his name and after the death of Habeeb Mohamed, \nthe defendants are enjoying the property and the defendants \nalso  perfected  title  by  adverse  possession  and  the \nplaintiff  never  claimed  right  nor  enjoyed  the  suit \nproperty.  As the defendants became the absolute owner of \nthe property, they demolished the existing construction and \nconstructed a pucca concrete building and therefore, the \nplaintiff is not entitled to the relief prayed for. \n5. The Trial Court framed the following issues:-\n\"1. Whether the plaintiff is the owner \nof the suit property?\n2. Whether the defendants have any right \nto demolish the old construction and put \nup new construction?\n3. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to \nRs.20,000/= towards the value of the old \nbuilding?\n5\n4. Whether the plaintiff is  entitled to \nthe relief of recovery of possession?\n5. Whether Habeeb Mohammed purchased the \nsuit property by oral sale?\n6.  Whether  the  old  construction  was \ndemolished  with  the  knowledge  of  the \nplaintiff?\n7.  Whether  the  defendants  perfected \ntitle by adverse possession?\n8.  To  what  relief,  the  plaintiff  is \nentitled?\"\n6.  On  the  side  of  the  plaintiff,  the  plaintiff \nexamined himself as PW1 and also examined another witness \nand marked 16 exhibits and on the side of the defendants, \nthe second defendant examined himself as DW1 and marked 27 \ndocuments and an advocate commissioner was appointed and he \nalso submitted a report and that was marked as Ex.C1. \n7. The Trial Court held that the defendants failed to \nprove the oral sale and also adverse possession and the \nplaintiff  proved  title  through  Ex.A2  partition  deed  and \neven  according  to  the  defendants,  the  old  structure  was \ndemolished only in the year 1985 and answered issues 1, 2 \nand 5 to 7 in favour of the plaintiff holding that the \n6\nplaintiff  has  got  title  to  the  suit  property  and  the \ndefendants have no right to demolish the old structure and \nput up new construction and the defendants failed to prove \noral  sale  by  the  plaintiff  or  his  mother  and  the  suit \nproperty was not demolished with the knowledge and consent \nof the plaintiff and the defendants have not proved adverse \npossession. The Trial Court also held that having regard to \nthe findings in respect of issue No.1 that the plaintiff \nhas got title to the suit property and the defendants did \nnot perfect title by adverse possession and the plaintiff \nis entitled to the relief of recovery of possession.  The \nTrial Court answered issue No.3 holding that the plaintiff \nis entitled to claim Rs.10,000/= towards the cost of the \nold building and decreed the suit accordingly.  Aggrieved \nby the same, this appeal is filed. \n8.  It  is  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \nappellant  that  the  Trial  Court,  without  properly \nappreciating the various exhibits filed by the appellants, \nerred in holding that the appellant failed to prove adverse \npossession.   The  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  also \nsubmitted that Exs.B2 to B5 are the House  Tax Receipts \nfrom  the  year  1970  and  therefore,  when  the  appellants \nproved their possession and enjoyment of the suit property \n7\nfrom the year 1970 through Exs.B2 to B5, the Trial Court \nought to have held that they perfected title by adverse \npossession  and  ought  to  have  dismissed  the  suit.   The \nlearned counsel for the appellant further submitted that \npossession  of  the  appellants  was  not  shared  by  the \nplaintiff and the plaintiff did not file any document to \nprove that they were in possession of the property at any \npoint of time and it is also admitted by the plaintiff that \nhe was living in foreign country and therefore, taking into \nconsideration  that  the  appellants  proved  their  title  by \nadverse  possession  from  the  year  1970,  the  Trial  Court \nought to have held that the appellant perfected title by \nadverse possession.  The learned counsel further submitted \nthat the Trial court erred in holding that the appellants \nfailed to prove the oral sale by the plaintiff's mother and \nsubmitted that under the Muslim Law, oral sale is permitted \nand it is the case of the appellants that they purchased \nthe property for a consideration of less than Rs.100/= and \ntherefore,  the  Trial  Court  ought  to  have  held  that  the \nplaintiff has no title to the suit property and therefore, \nthe plaintiff is not entitled to declaration and recovery \nof possession. \n9. On the basis of above submissions, the following \n8\npoints arise for consideration in this appeal:-\n\"1.  Whether  the  appellants  perfected \ntitle  by  adverse  possession  over  the \nsuit property?\n2.  Whether  the  appellants  proved  the \noral sale?\n3.  Whether  the  plaintiffs  proved  the \ntitle?\"\n10. It is submitted by the learned counsel for the \nappellants  that  under  the  partition  deed,  Ex.A2,  'C' \nschedule property was allotted to the plaintiff's mother. \nIt is seen from Ex.A2 that one house was divided into three \nportions and 'C' portion was allotted to the share of the \nmother of the plaintiff.  It is the further case of the \nappellants  that  their  predecessor-in-title  viz.",

Whether  the  Appellate  Tribunal  was  justified  in \nignoring the law that in matter of classification, identification \nof  an  entry  is  the  primary  step,  which  is  concerned  with \ngoods and not with description of goods, since the description \nwould be relevant for the application of particular entry, for a \nsingle entry refers to a large number of goods of different \ntypes, since it is not possible to encapsulate them completely \nunder the comprehensive titles ((2005)5RC 666) ?\n2.  Whether  the  Appellate  Tribunal  failed  to \nappreciate the law that when entry 80/Part B of the First \nSchedule  being  \"maize  products\"  would  include  all  the \ngoods predominantly made out of maize unless there being \nany contrary intention indicated by the legislature as in the \ncase of other goods? \"\n2.  The  assessee  herein  is  a  registered  dealer  carrying  on \nbusiness in food products made  of maize.  Admittedly, the assessee \ndeals in branded food products.  The assessee was originally assessed \nin respect of sale of  products made of maize under Sl.No. 80, Part B \nFirst  Schedule  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Value  Added  Tax  Act,  2006. \n3\n(hereinafter called as the \"Act\")  However, the said assessment  on \nmaize products was sought to be revised under Section 27(1)(b) of the \nAct, assessing the turnover at 12.5% as an unclassified item falling \nunder Entry 69 Part C of First Schedule to the Act. Since the assessee \ndid not reply to the notice, the assessment proposed was confirmed.  \n3. Aggrieved by this, the assessee went on appeal before the \nAppellate Deputy Commissioner, questioning the rate of tax contending \nthat these products are wholly made of  corn or maize. The assessee \ncontented that  Appalam, Papad, Vadam and Vathal which falls under \nitem Sl.No.4 of Part B under IV Schedule, is totally exempt from tax; \nthat the maize products sold under the brand name of PEPPY, Cheese \nBalls,  Senon Papito,  Tortilla  Chips,  Peppy  Eatos  etc.,  all  are  maize \nproducts, assessable under Sl.No. 80, Part B First Schedule to the Act \nat 4%; that the Entry does not say anything that frying or flavouring \nwould make the maize product different  by reason of which it may not \nfall under  Serial No.80 of Part B of First Schedule to the Act. It further \ncontended that just because the maize product is sold in the brand \nname,  the  revised  assessment  levying  higher  rate  of  tax  is  totally \nuncalled for. The assessee enclosed the treatment under the Central \nExcise  Act  as  well  as  the  ruling  of  Advance  Ruling  Authority  of \n4\nKarnataka State, wherein, the maize products are exempted from the \nlevy of tax and contended that the assessment be set aside.  \n4.  The  First  Appellate  Authority  agreed  with  the  assessee's \ncontention by following the decision of the Advance Ruling Authority of \nKarnataka State in Order  No.222/05 dated 31.03.2006 holding that \n\"Senor Pepito contillaa chips\" is nothing but \"Pappad\", hence, eligible \nfor  exemption. He pointed out that the laboratory test showed that \nthey  are  all  products  of  maize.  Thus,  accepting  the  case  of  the \nassessee, the first Appellate Authority held that the assessment could \nnot be made under the residuary item, but only under Sl.No. 80, Part \nB of the First Schedule to the Act.  \n5. The Revenue took this matter on appeal before the Sales Tax \nAppellate  Tribunal,  who  set  aside  the  order  of  the  First  Appellate \nAuthority and restored the order of assessment.  \n6. A reading of the order of the Tamil Nadu Sales Tax Appellate \nTribunal shows that samples were produced by the assessee and that \nthe original contents of the packing showed that the product name is \n\"Peppy  Cheese  Balls\"  and  \"Senor  Pepito  Tortilla  Chips\",  which  are \n5\nready to eat snack item, no doubt they are maize based, but could not \nbe  classified  as  maize  products.   The  Sales  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal \nfurther  pointed  out  that  the  assessee  had  pasted  the  label  'maize \nproduct'  manually  on  the  packing  material  to  establish  that  the \nproducts sold are maize products only.  It was further pointed out that \nin  one  sample,  the  cheese  balls  are  sold  under  the  brand  name \n\"Peppy\"  and  another  under  the  brand  name  \"Tortilla  Chips\".  Thus \nbeing ready to eat snack items and being branded items, they are \nliable to be assessed at 12.5% tax.  Aggrieved by this, the present Tax \nCase (Revision) is preferred by the assessee.  \n7. Learned counsel appearing for the assessee placed before us \nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of Collector of Central \nExcise  Vs.  Protein  Products  of  India reported  in  1988  (38) \nE.L.T.749 (S.C.) to emphasise on the expression \"product\" to hold \nthat in the case of gelatine obtained by chemical treatment of bones, \nthe  Apex  Court  held  that  they  are  all  bone  products,  entitled  to \nexemption.   The  Apex  Court  referred  to  Webster's  Comprehensive \nDictionary on the word \"product\" as \"anything produced or obtained as \na result of some operation of work\",  thus, bone products were held to \nbe anything produced or obtained from bones; whether such derivation \n6\nis  by a simple physical  process or  by a chemical  reaction made no \ndifference to the end product.  Thus, buttermilk does not cease to be a \nmilk  product  merely  because  a  chemical  process  is  involved  in  the \ntransformation.  \n8. Learned counsel further placed before us the decision of the \nAllahabad High Court in the case of Commissioner of Sales Tax Vs. \nKwality Restaurant reported in (1980)45 STC 486 and the decision \nin  the  case  of  Commissioner,  Sales  Tax  Vs.  Rita  Ice  Cream \nreported in (1982) 49 STC 297 (Allahabad) as well as the decision \nof  the  Delhi  High  Court  in  the  case  of  Gian  Chand  Halwai  Vs. \nCommissioner  of  Sales  Tax. The  Allahabad  High  Court,  in  the \ndecision reported in (1980) 45 STC 486 (cited supra) referred to \nthe decision in the case of  Kwality Ice Cream Co Vs. Sales Tax \nOfficer reported in (1974) 34 STC 396, wherein, Ice cream was held \nas  milk  product.   Thus,  adopting the  view expressed  in  the  above \njudgments, learned counsel appearing for the assessee submitted that \nPeppy, Cheese Balls, Senon Papito, Tortilla Chips, Peppy Eatos etc., \nsold in the brand names is nothing but maize products, liable to be \nassessed under Sl.No.80 Part B of the First Schedule to the Act.  He \nalso took us through the manufacturing process of Tortilla Chips and \n7\nCheese Balls.  In the case of Cheese Balls, after grinding the whole \nmaize,  the same is round shaped as corn balls  and to this, cheese \nflavour and the vegetable oil are added; in the case of Tortilla Chips, \nafter grinding the whole maize,  the same is made into a thick paste, \nthey are cut into required shape and baked in oven, thereafter flash \nfrying in vegetable oil and seasoning, the product is packed.  \n9. As pointed out rightly by the Sales Tax Appellate Tribunal, the \nitem in question, even though are maize based, that, by itself, does \nnot make the item in question a maize product.  \n10. Learned counsel appearing for the petitioner placed before us \nthe Wikipedia Dictionary meaning as to various maize products to drive \nthe point that the chips as well as the corn balls are nothing but maize \nproducts.  \n11.  The  materials  placed  before  this  Court  merely  show that \nmaize  is  used  as  a  base  for  making  corn  muffins,  cornbread  and \nbreads.   Leaving  aside  the  question  of  relevance  of  wikipedia \ndictionary, it is relevant to see how the marketable product is made. It \nis seen from the narration given in the typed set of papers that the \n8\ncheese  balls  and  tortilla  chips   are  made  with  the  ground  maize \npowder,  to  which,  cheese  flavour  and  seasoning  are  added.  To  be \ncalled a product, the item in question must retain the essential nature \nor substantial identity of that commodity, out of which it is made of a \nthing. To qualify  as a product,  an item in question may undergo a \nchange in the form;  but nevertheless, it must retain  the  substantial \nidentity of the original product.",

Mr.Kuppusamy,  the  son  of  Mr.Ellappa \nNaicker  who had inherited the said property along with the second \npetitioner herein also was not aware of the acquisition proceedings. An \nenquiry appears to have been conducted under Section 5-A of the Act. \nBut,  no  notice  was  served  either  on  Mr.Kuppusamy  or  on  the \n4\npetitioners 1 and 2 herein. The Special Tahsildar on completing the \nenquiry, had submitted a report to the Government. On accepting the \nsaid report, the Government issued G.O.Ms.No.996 Housing & Urban \nDevelopment  Department  dated  17.06.1991,  thereby  acquiring \n21.83.0 hectares of land including the lands belonging to Mr.Ellappa \nNaicker mentioned above. The said notification under Section 6 of the \nAct  was  published  in  the  Tamil  Nadu  Government  Gazette  on \n19.06.1991. \n4.According to the petitioners, the said acquisition proceedings \nwere not known to the petitioners. It is stated by the respondents that \nsubsequent  to  the  above  declaration  under  Section  6  of  the  Act, \nproceedings  were  conducted  for  determining  the  amount  of \ncompensation.  Accordingly,  three  awards  were  made  under  Award \nNos.2/1993 dated 18.06.1993; 1/1998 dated 30.06.1998 and 1/2001 \ndated 23.11.2001 respectively. In so far as the lands in question are \nconcerned,  award  was  passed  under  Award  No.2/1993  dated \n18.06.1993 itself. \n5.According  to  the  petitioners,  without  knowing  all  the  above \n5\ndevelopments believing honestly that they continued to be the owners \nof the lands in question, they developed the said lands into house-sites \nand sold away the plots to the petitioners 3 to 7 herein. Thus, the \npetitioners 3 to 7 herein have become the absolute owners of the said \nlands and they have constructed packa houses on the said properties \nand they are now occupying the same.\n6.While so, the Tamil Nadu Housing Board issued notices to the \npetitioners calling upon them to vacate the premises and to hand over \nvacant possession of the same as the Tamil Nadu Housing Board has \nbecome the  absolute  owner  of  the  property,  as  per  the  acquisition \nmade under Section 6 of the Act, and also on the allegation that the \npossession was  also  handed over  by the  Government  to  the  Tamil \nNadu Housing  Board.  The  said  notice  of  eviction  was  issued under \nSection 84(2) of the Tamil Nadu Housing Board Act.  According to the \npetitioners,  they  came  to  know  about  the  above  acquisition \nproceedings  only  after  the  above  notice  dated  12.12.2005. \nImmediately,  the  petitioners  have  come  up  with  this  writ  petition \nchallenging the entire acquisition proceedings.\n6\n7.The Tamil  Nadu Housing Board has  filed  a  detailed counter \nwhich  has  been  adopted by  the  respondents  1  and  2.  In  the  said \ncounter,  inter alia, it is stated that this writ petition which was filed \nlong after  passing of  the award is  not maintainable, in view of the \njudgment  of  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  Municipal  Council, \nAhmednagar v. Shah Hyder Beig  (2000 (2) SCC 48). It is further \ncontended in the counter that the notice under Section 4(1) of the Act, \nwas issued in respect of the lands in question only in the name of \nMr.Ellappa  Naicker  because,  in  the  revenue  records,  the  name  of \nMr.Ellappa Naicker was found as the owner of the land in question. It is \nfurther stated in the counter that an enquiry was appropriately held by \nthe  competent  authority  under  Section  5-A  of  the  Act.  All  the \nobjections raised by the land owners were all considered and finally, \nthe Special Tahsildar submitted a report recommending for acquisition \nof these lands thereby rejecting the objections. It is further stated in \nthe  counter  that  thereafter,  the  Government  considered  all  the \nrelevant materials and issued a notification under Section 6 of the Act \nunder  G.O.Ms.No.996  dated  17.06.1991.  It  is  also  stated  that \nsubsequently,  possession  was  taken and  handed over  to  the  Tamil \nNadu Housing Board. It is finally contended that the petitioners are \ntreated only as encroachers as their occupation is unauthorized and \n7\ntherefore,  they  are  liable  to  be  evicted.  In  view  of  all  the  above, \naccording  to  the  respondents,  this  writ  petition  is  liable  to  be \ndismissed.\n8.I  have  heard  the  learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the \npetitioners; the learned Special Government Pleader appearing for the \nrespondents 1 and 3 and I have also perused the records carefully. \nThere is no representation for the respondents 2 and 4. \n9.For  the  sake  of  convenience,  let  me take  up  the  objection \nregarding  the  maintainability  of  this  writ  petition  at  first.  It  is  the \ncontention of the respondents that this writ petition which was filed in \nthe year 2006 long after passing of the award in the year 1993, is not \nat all maintainable, in view of the judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme \nCourt  in   Municipal  Council,  Ahmednagar v.  Shah Hyder Beig, \ncase (cited supra).",

The  plaintiff  filed  the  suit  for  partition  and \nseparate possession of 1.30.5 acres of land from the suit \nproperty by dividing the property by metes and bounds or in \nthe alternative, to declare that the plaintiff is entitled \nto 1.30.5 acres of land from and out of the western 8.25 \n3\nacres  in  S.No.825/2A1  of  the  suit  property  and  for \ndirection to defendants 1 to 9 to deliver possession of \nthat 1.30.5 acres to the plaintiff.  The suit was dismissed \nand as against the same, this appeal is filed. \n3. The case of the plaintiff as seen from the plaint \nis as follows:-\nThe  plaintiff's  mother  Devakkal  purchased  the \nundivided  6.95.5  acres  in  S.No.825/2  in  Karuthampatti \nVillage from one Royappa Chettiar under a registered sale \ndeed dated 29.4.1937 and was in possession of the same. \nS.No.825/2  was  having  an  extent  of  13.91  acres  and  the \nplaintiff's  mother  purchased  undivided  half  share  viz., \n6.95.5 acres and the remaining 6.95.5 acres belonged to one \nKrishnasamy Pulavar and the said Krishnasamy Pulavar was \nenjoying  the  western  6.95.5  acres  and  the  plaintiff's \nmother was enjoying  the eastern 6.95.5 acres.  After the \ndeath of Devakkal, the plaintiff and her two sisters and \ntheir  brother  succeeded  to   the  said  property  and  the \nplaintiff's sisters and brother sold their 3/4 share to the \nplaintiff  and  her  husband  Palaniappa  Gounder  under  a \nregistered  sale  deed  dated  1.6.1950  and  therefore,  the \nplaintiff became entitled to 6.95.5 acres.  The plaintiff \nand  her  husband  mortgaged  that  extent  to  Krishnasamy \n4\nPulavar  and  on  28.9.1950,  they  sold  3.25  acres  to  one \nVelusamy  Pulavar  and  the  property  sold  to  Velusamy  was \nabutting the property belonged to Krishnasamy Pulavar on \nthe  western  side  and  abutting  the  remaining  property \nbelonged  to  the  plaintiff  and  her  husband.   Thereafter, \nVelusamy Pulavar sold that extent under a registered sale \ndeed dated 30.4.1952 in favour of one Sellappa Gounder and \nlater Sellappa Gounder sold that portion under a registered \nsale  deed  dated  9.3.1977  to  the  10th defendant.   The \nplaintiff has further stated that her husband Palaniappa \nGounder settled 75 cents out of the remaining 3.70.5 acres \nin  favour  of  the  plaintiff  under  a  registered  document \ndated  3.4.1964  and  on  16.2.1983,  the  plaintiff  and  her \nhusband sold 40 cents to one Kuppusamy  and the plaintiff \nalso settled two acres under a registered settlement deed \ndated 15.4.1983 to her sons viz., defendants 11 and 12.  It \nis further stated that while selling the extent of 3.25 \nacres to Velusamy Pulavar, the plaintiff wrongly mentioned \nin that sale deed that they are having the remaining 2-3/4 \nacres instead of 3/3/4 acres and having regard to the total \nextent  of  the  land  viz.,  6.95.5  acres  owned  by  the \nplaintiff  and  her  husband,  after  selling  3.25  acres  to \nVelusamy  Pulavar,  the  plaintiff  was  entitled  to  3.70.5 \n5\nacres but, in the sale deed executed in favour of Velusamy \nPulavar,  it  was  wrongly  mentioned  as  2.75  acres. \nTherefore, after settlement by the plaintiff's husband to \nthe plaintiff and the sale by the plaintiff and her husband \nto Kuppusamy and the settlement of 2 acres to defendants 11 \nand 12 , the plaintiff is entitled to 1.30.5 acres  and \nthat portion was encroached by the 10th defendant when the \nplaintiff was residing at Ooty. It  is  further  stated \nthat the said Krishnasamy Pulavar, who was the owner of the \nwestern  half  viz.,  6.95.5  acres,  sold  his  western  half \nunder  a  registered  sale  deed  dated  21.3.1952  to  one \nSubbanachary and defendants 1 to 7 are the legal heirs of \nSubbanachary and they executed a power in favour of the \neighth  defendant  and  acting  on  the  power,  the  eighth \ndefendant entered into an agreement of sale in respect of \n8.25 acres taking advantage of the patta in their favour \nand therefore, the suit was filed for the reliefs as stated \nabove. \n4. The eighth defendant filed written statement and \nthe same was adopted by defendants 1 to 7, 9 and 14 to 16. \nThe  defendants  contended  that  even  according  to  the \nplaintiff,  there  was  a  division  of  the  properties  into \nwestern and eastern half and the plaintiff's predecessor-\n6\nin-title  was  in  possession  of  the  eastern  half  and \nSubbanachary  was  in  possession  of  the  western  half  and \ntherefore, the parties enjoyed the properties with specific \nboundaries and they also divided the properties by their \nmode of enjoyment and therefore, the suit for partition is \nnot maintainable.  It is further admitted that S.No.825/2 \nas stood originally was of an extent of 13.91 acres and \nlater the properties found in possession of defendants 1 to \n7 and was given sub-division as S.No.825/2A1 and it was \nhaving an extent of 8.25 acres and patta was granted in \nfavour of the predecessor-in-title of defendants 1 to 7 and \ntherefore, the plaintiff cannot claim any title or right \nover  the  defendants'  property.   The  defendants  further \nstated that the land on the eastern side was abutting the \ntwo main roads viz., the National Highways on the south and \nthe Somanur-Annur Road on the east and that was the reason \nfor the lesser extent by reason of the road frontage and \nthe plaintiff and her husband were aware of the deficit and \nin  the  sale  deeds  also,  that  was  reflected  and  the \nplaintiff and her husband sold 3.25 acres on the eastern \nside within the specific boundaries and while selling that \nextent, the western portion was said to be the property of \nKrishnasamy Pulavar, now belonging to defendants 1 to 7 and \n7\nthe  eastern  boundary  was  said  to  be  the  remaining  2.75 \nacres and that was the land available on the eastern side \nand therefore, it is not open to the plaintiff to contend \nnow that she is entitled to 3.75 acres after selling 3.25 \nacres to the said Velusamy Pulavar and therefore, she is \nentitled  to  1.30.5  acres.  Further,  the  arithmetic \ncalculation made in the plaint to claim 1.30 acres cannot \nbe accepted and having regard to the recitals in various \ndocuments  executed  by  the  plaintiff  and  her  husband  to \nVelusamy, Kuppusamy and settlement in favour of defendants \n11 and 12 would make it clear that the plaintiff has sold \nthe entire extent and she is not having any property and \ntherefore, she is also not entitled to claim any share. \nThe defendants also contended that they had perfected title \nby  adverse  possession  as  they  are  in  enjoyment  of  the \nproperty for more than twelve years and as the owners of \nthe property, defendants 1 to 7 are legally entitled to \nsell  their  extent  to  the  ninth  defendant  and  the  same \ncannot be challenged by the plaintiff.",

Respondents\nWrit petition under Article 226 of the Constitution of India filed praying \nfor issuance of a writ of Habeas Corpus calling for the records of the detention \norder dated 13.04.2013 made in BDFGISSV No.66/2013 passed by the second \nrespondent  and  quash  the  same  and  set  the  detenue  Kathiravan,  aged  35 \nyears, son of Munirasu, residing at No.2/4, Gandhi Street, Singaperumal Koil \nVillage, Chinglepet Taluk, Kanchipuram District, now lodged in Central Prison, \nPuzhal, Chennai – 600 006 at liberty.\nFor Petitioner : Mr.S.Udhayakumar\nFor Respondents : Mr.M.Maharaja,\n   Additional Public Prosecutor\n2\nO R D E R\n(Order of the Court was made by V.DHANAPALAN,J.,)\nThe petitioner is the wife of the detenu, who has been branded as a \n\"Goonda\" as contemplated under the Tamil Nadu Act 14 of 1982 and detained \nunder order of the second respondent passed in BDFGISSV No.66 of 2013, dated \n13.04.2013.\n2. The detenu came to adverse notice in Crime No.635 of 2012 on the \nfile of Maraimalai Nagar Police Station for offences under Sections 147, 148, \n341 and 302 IPC. \n3. The alleged ground case has been registered against the detenu on \n09.03.2013,  by  the  Inspector  of  Police,  Maraimalai  Nagar  Police  Station  in \nCrime No.143 of 2013 for offences under Sections 147, 148, 341, 294(b), 395, \n307 and 506(ii) IPC. Aggrieved by the order of detention, the present Habeas \nCorpus Petition has been filed.\n4. Though the learned counsel for the petitioner has raised several other \ngrounds to assail the order of detention, he mainly focussed his arguments on \nthe ground that there is a delay in considering the petitioner's representation \ndated 06.05.2013, which would vitiate the impugned detention order.\n3\n5. We have heard the learned Additional Public Prosecutor on the above \nsubmissions.\n6.  On  verification,  it  is  seen  that  the  petitioner  has  made  a \nrepresentation  to  the  1st respondent  on  06.05.2013,  whereas  the  details \nfurnished by the learned Additional Public Prosecutor reveal that it is dated \nnil. However, the same was received by the respondents on 17.05.2013 and \nthereafter, remarks were called for on 20.05.2013, but remarks were received \nonly on 29.05.2013. Thereafter, the Under Secretary and Deputy Secretary to \nGovernment  dealt  with  the  file  and  ultimately,  the  representation  was \nrejected on 06.06.2013. While examining the above position, it is evident that \nthere is a delay of 12 days, after giving concession for intermittent Saturdays \nand Sundays, in considering the representation of the petitioner, which would \nvitiate the impugned detention order.\n7. In similar circumstances, the Supreme Court, in the case of  Rashid \nKapadia vs. Medha Gadgil and others reported in (2012) 11 SCC 745, has held \nas follows:\n\"12. It can be seen from the above extracted portion that  \nthe  first  respondent  called  for  the  parawise  remarks  of  the  \nsponsoring  authority  (Customs  Department)  on  09.08.2011.  \nHowever, the sponsoring authority responded to the inquiry of the  \nfirst respondent on 26.08.2011 with a delay of fifteen days.  The  \nreasons for such delay have not been explained by the sponsoring  \n4\nauthority,  represented by the third  respondent herein.  There is  \nnothing  on  the  record  placed  before  us,  which  explains  the  \nabovementioned  delay  on  the  part  of  the  third  respondent's  \nDepartment.  \n13. It is well settled that the right  of a person, who is  \npreventively  detained,  to  make  a  representation  and  have  it  \nconsidered by the authority concerned as expeditiously as possible,  \nis a constitutional right under Article 22(5).  Any unreasonable and  \nun explainable delay in considering the representation is held to be  \nfatal to the continued detention of the detenu.  The proposition is  \ntoo well settled in a long line of decisions of this Court.  We do not  \nthink it necessary to examine the authorities on this aspect, except  \nto  take  note  of  a  couple  of  judgments  where  the  principle  is  \ndiscussed in detail. ...\n14. Therefore,  we  have  no  option  but  to  come  to  the  \nconclusion  that  the  detention  order  cannot  be  sustained  on  the  \nabovementioned ground alone and it is required to be, accordingly,  \nset aside.\"\n8. Taking note of the ratio laid down by the Supreme Court in the above \njudgment and considering the facts of the case, the impugned detention order \npassed by the second respondent, detaining the detenu, namely, Kathiravan \nS/o. Munirasu made in BDFGISSV No.66 of 2013 dated 13.04.2013 is vitiated on \nthe ground of delay and therefore it is quashed and the Habeas Corpus Petition \nis allowed.  The above named detenu is ordered to be set at liberty forthwith, \nunless his custody is required in connection with any other case.\n9. However, we make it clear that it is for the respondents to take note \n5\nof the gravity of the offence and they shall prosecute the case before the trial \nCourt without being influenced by this order. Likewise, the detenu shall not \ntake any advantage of this order in any of the regular proceedings.\n[V.D.P.,J.]  [C.T.S.,J.]\n                    13.08.2013 \nIndex : Yes / No\nInternet : Yes / No\ngm/abe\nTo \n1.The Secretary to Government,\n   Home Department,\n   Government of Tamil Nadu,\n   Fort St. George, Chennai.\n2.The District Collector and District Magistrate,\n   Kancheepuram District,\n   Kancheepuram.\n3.The Inspector of Police,\n   Maraimalai Nagar Police Station,\n   Kancheepuram District.   \n4.The Public Prosecutor\n   High Court of Madras,\n   Chennai.\nV.

The plaintiff filed the suit for partition of his \nhalf share and the suit was dismissed and aggrieved by the \nsame, this appeal is filed. The case of the plaintiff as \nseen from the plaint is as follows:-\nThe  suit  properties  and  other  properties  originally \nbelonged to Subroya Nainar and he had two sons, Irusappa \nNainar and Ramasami Nainar and the plaintiff is the son of \nIrusappa  Nainar.   The  first  defendant  is  the  son  of \nRamasami  Nainar.   On  6.12.1950,  there  was  a  partition \nbetween the plaintiff and Ramasami Nainar evidenced by two \n3\nunregistered partition deeds and in the partition deeds, \n'A' schedule properties mentioned therein were allotted to \nthe share of Ramasami Nainar and 'B' schedule property was \nallotted to the share of the plaintiff and 'C' schedule \nproperty was kept in common.  As per the partition list, \nthe common debts were to be discharged by the sale of 'C' \nschedule properties.  However, 'C' schedule properties were \nto  be  utilized  for  performing  Dharmams.  The  plaintiff's \nuncle Ramasami Nainar was managing 'C' schedule properties \nas he was the seniormost member of the family and from the \nincome  from  'C'  schedule  properties  mentioned  in  the \npartition list, the suit properties were purchased for the \npurpose of constructing a school and after purchase of the \nland,  the  plaintiff  and  his  uncle  Ramasami  Nainar \nconstructed  a  school  by  name  'Raman  Higher  Secondary \nSchool' and it was managed by the plaintiff and his uncle. \nA  trust  deed  dated  15.4.1959  was  also  executed  by  the \nplaintiff and his uncle Ramasami Nainar for the purpose of \nrunning the school and the school was running till 1986 \nand  as  the  buildings  became  dilapidated,  the  school  was \ntaken  over  by  the  Government  and  the  area  kept  by  the \nschool  is  having  an  extent  of  5  acres  59  cents  and  it \nremained vacant and that is the suit property mentioned in \n4\n'A' schedule and the other properties which are mentioned \nin  'C'  schedule  as  per  the  earlier  partition  list  and \nenjoyed by the plaintiff and his uncle Ramasami Nainar were \nacquired by the Government and the compensation was shared \nby  them.   Ramasami  Nainar  died  in  the  year  1972  and \ntherefore, the plaintiff and the first defendant are each \nentitled  to  half  share.   However,  the  first  defendant \nplotted the suit A schedule property and sold various plots \nin favour of defendants 2 to 29 and the properties sold by \nthe first defendant to defendants 2 to 29 are mentioned in \nB schedule.  The sales by the first defendant in respect of \nA schedule property are not binding on the plaintiff and \nthe plaintiff has got half share in A schedule property \nmentioned in the plaint and therefore, the suit was filed \nfor partition of half share in A schedule properties.  \n3. The first defendant contested the suit admitting \nthat  the  A  schedule  property  mentioned  in  the  suit  was \nincluded  in  the  schedule  'C'  of  the  partition  deed  as \nstated  in  the  plaint.  Nevertheless,  the  first  defendant \ndenied  the  allegations  that  'C'  schedule  properties \nmentioned in the partition of the year 1950 were leased out \nand also denied the allegation that the school was  managed \nby Ramasami Nainar and the plaintiff and according to the \n5\ndefendant, the school was managed by Ramasami Nainar and \nthe plaintiff never evinced any interest nor exercised any \nright over the administration of the school or over the \nother properties which are mentioned in the 'C' schedule to \nthe partition deed of the year 1950. The plaintiff also \nlost his right by ouster.  It is further stated that the \nschool  was  surrendered  by  the  first  defendant's  father \nRamasami  Nainar  to  the  Government  and  the  A  schedule \nproperty  mentioned  in  the  plaint  was  treated  as  the \nproperty  of  the  first  defendant  and  the  plaintiff  never \nreceived any compensation in respect of the lands acquired \nby the Government. As the plaintiff lost his right by not \nexercising  any  right  over  the  suit  property,  he  is  not \nentitled to the relief of partition and therefore, the suit \nis liable to be dismissed. \n4. The 14th defendant filed statement stating that if \nfor any reason, the suit is decreed, the property purchased \nby him can be allotted to the share of the first defendant \nso  that  he  can  exercise  his  equity  in  the  final  decree \nproceedings. \n5. On the above pleadings, the Trial Court framed the \nfollowing issues:-\n\"1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to \n6\nany share in the 'C' schedule mentioned \nin the earlier partition suit?\n2.  Whether the  first defendant  ousted \nthe plaintiff from the enjoyment of the \nsuit properties?\n3. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to \nthe relief of partition?\n4.  Whether  the  sales  effected  by  the \nfirst defendant in favour of defendants \n2 to 29 are binding on the plaintiff?\n5. Whether the suit is properly valued?\n6.  To  what  relief,  the  plaintiff  is \nentitled?\"\nThe additional issues framed are as follows:-\n\"1. Whether the sale in favour of the \n14th defendant  by  the  first  defendant \nwas for proper value?\n2. Whether the property purchased by the \n14th defendant has to be allotted in the \nevent of any decree being passed to the \nshare of the first defendant?\"\n6. Issue No.5 was answered in favour of the plaintiff \nholding that the suit was properly valued.  Issues 1 to 3 \n7\nwere tried together and the Trial Court held that the suit \nwas not filed in respect of the properties mentioned in 'C' \nschedule to the earlier partition list of the year 1950 and \nonly two items are included in the suit and therefore, the \nsuit is bad for partial partition and the first defendant \nand his father were enjoying the property from the year \n1971 to the exclusion of the plaintiff and therefore, it \ncan be presumed that the plaintiff waived his share and the \nfirst defendant was enjoying the property from 1971 to the \nexclusion  of  the  plaintiff  and  also  perfected  title  by \nadverse possession and the plaintiff is not entitled to the \nrelief of partition. \n7.  Issue  No.4  was  answered  in  favour  of  the  first \ndefendant holding that the sales in favour of defendants 2 \nto 29 are valid and binding on the plaintiff and additional \nissue No.1 was answered in favour of the 14th defendant and \nadditional issue No.2 was answered as unnecessary as the \nplaintiff  was  not  entitled  to  claim  any  partition  in \nrespect of those properties and in the result, the suit was \ndismissed and aggrieved by the same, the present appeal is \nfiled. \n8.  It  is  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \nappellants that the court below, having found that the suit \n8\nproperties were included in the 'C' schedule in the earlier \npartition  of  the  year  1950,  ought  to  have  held  that  A \nschedule properties are the joint family properties of the \nplaintiff and the first defendant and they are the joint \nowners and there cannot be any adverse possession against \nthe  co-owner  and  the  Trial  Court,  without  properly \nappreciating the judgment reported in AIR 1981 SC 77 and \n1991 LW 296 cited by the plaintiff before the Trial Court, \nerred in holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to the \npartition.  The learned counsel further submitted that the \nfirst defendant has not produced any evidence to prove the \nouster  of  the  plaintiff  and  the  documents  filed  by  the \nfirst defendant will not also prove ouster and between the \nco-owners, there is no question of adverse possession and \nthe first defendant did not prove that the plaintiff was \nousted from the enjoyment of the property and the enjoyment \nof the property by one co-owner and the non-participation \nin enjoyment of the property nor its income by the other \nowner will not amount to ouster as held by the Honourable \nSupreme Court in the judgment in AIR 1981 SC 77 and 1991 LW \n296 and therefore, the court below ought to have decreed \nthe suit.",

The plaintiff filed the suit for partition of his \nhalf share and the suit was dismissed and aggrieved by the \nsame, this appeal is filed. The case of the plaintiff as \nseen from the plaint is as follows:-\nThe  suit  properties  and  other  properties  originally \nbelonged to Subroya Nainar and he had two sons, Irusappa \nNainar and Ramasami Nainar and the plaintiff is the son of \nIrusappa  Nainar.   The  first  defendant  is  the  son  of \nRamasami  Nainar.   On  6.12.1950,  there  was  a  partition \nbetween the plaintiff and Ramasami Nainar evidenced by two \n3\nunregistered partition deeds and in the partition deeds, \n'A' schedule properties mentioned therein were allotted to \nthe share of Ramasami Nainar and 'B' schedule property was \nallotted to the share of the plaintiff and 'C' schedule \nproperty was kept in common.  As per the partition list, \nthe common debts were to be discharged by the sale of 'C' \nschedule properties.  However, 'C' schedule properties were \nto  be  utilized  for  performing  Dharmams.  The  plaintiff's \nuncle Ramasami Nainar was managing 'C' schedule properties \nas he was the seniormost member of the family and from the \nincome  from  'C'  schedule  properties  mentioned  in  the \npartition list, the suit properties were purchased for the \npurpose of constructing a school and after purchase of the \nland,  the  plaintiff  and  his  uncle  Ramasami  Nainar \nconstructed  a  school  by  name  'Raman  Higher  Secondary \nSchool' and it was managed by the plaintiff and his uncle. \nA  trust  deed  dated  15.4.1959  was  also  executed  by  the \nplaintiff and his uncle Ramasami Nainar for the purpose of \nrunning the school and the school was running till 1986 \nand  as  the  buildings  became  dilapidated,  the  school  was \ntaken  over  by  the  Government  and  the  area  kept  by  the \nschool  is  having  an  extent  of  5  acres  59  cents  and  it \nremained vacant and that is the suit property mentioned in \n4\n'A' schedule and the other properties which are mentioned \nin  'C'  schedule  as  per  the  earlier  partition  list  and \nenjoyed by the plaintiff and his uncle Ramasami Nainar were \nacquired by the Government and the compensation was shared \nby  them.   Ramasami  Nainar  died  in  the  year  1972  and \ntherefore, the plaintiff and the first defendant are each \nentitled  to  half  share.   However,  the  first  defendant \nplotted the suit A schedule property and sold various plots \nin favour of defendants 2 to 29 and the properties sold by \nthe first defendant to defendants 2 to 29 are mentioned in \nB schedule.  The sales by the first defendant in respect of \nA schedule property are not binding on the plaintiff and \nthe plaintiff has got half share in A schedule property \nmentioned in the plaint and therefore, the suit was filed \nfor partition of half share in A schedule properties.  \n3. The first defendant contested the suit admitting \nthat  the  A  schedule  property  mentioned  in  the  suit  was \nincluded  in  the  schedule  'C'  of  the  partition  deed  as \nstated  in  the  plaint.  Nevertheless,  the  first  defendant \ndenied  the  allegations  that  'C'  schedule  properties \nmentioned in the partition of the year 1950 were leased out \nand also denied the allegation that the school was  managed \nby Ramasami Nainar and the plaintiff and according to the \n5\ndefendant, the school was managed by Ramasami Nainar and \nthe plaintiff never evinced any interest nor exercised any \nright over the administration of the school or over the \nother properties which are mentioned in the 'C' schedule to \nthe partition deed of the year 1950. The plaintiff also \nlost his right by ouster.  It is further stated that the \nschool  was  surrendered  by  the  first  defendant's  father \nRamasami  Nainar  to  the  Government  and  the  A  schedule \nproperty  mentioned  in  the  plaint  was  treated  as  the \nproperty  of  the  first  defendant  and  the  plaintiff  never \nreceived any compensation in respect of the lands acquired \nby the Government. As the plaintiff lost his right by not \nexercising  any  right  over  the  suit  property,  he  is  not \nentitled to the relief of partition and therefore, the suit \nis liable to be dismissed. \n4. The 14th defendant filed statement stating that if \nfor any reason, the suit is decreed, the property purchased \nby him can be allotted to the share of the first defendant \nso  that  he  can  exercise  his  equity  in  the  final  decree \nproceedings. \n5. On the above pleadings, the Trial Court framed the \nfollowing issues:-\n\"1. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to \n6\nany share in the 'C' schedule mentioned \nin the earlier partition suit?\n2.  Whether the  first defendant  ousted \nthe plaintiff from the enjoyment of the \nsuit properties?\n3. Whether the plaintiff is entitled to \nthe relief of partition?\n4.  Whether  the  sales  effected  by  the \nfirst defendant in favour of defendants \n2 to 29 are binding on the plaintiff?\n5. Whether the suit is properly valued?\n6.  To  what  relief,  the  plaintiff  is \nentitled?\"\nThe additional issues framed are as follows:-\n\"1. Whether the sale in favour of the \n14th defendant  by  the  first  defendant \nwas for proper value?\n2. Whether the property purchased by the \n14th defendant has to be allotted in the \nevent of any decree being passed to the \nshare of the first defendant?\"\n6. Issue No.5 was answered in favour of the plaintiff \nholding that the suit was properly valued.  Issues 1 to 3 \n7\nwere tried together and the Trial Court held that the suit \nwas not filed in respect of the properties mentioned in 'C' \nschedule to the earlier partition list of the year 1950 and \nonly two items are included in the suit and therefore, the \nsuit is bad for partial partition and the first defendant \nand his father were enjoying the property from the year \n1971 to the exclusion of the plaintiff and therefore, it \ncan be presumed that the plaintiff waived his share and the \nfirst defendant was enjoying the property from 1971 to the \nexclusion  of  the  plaintiff  and  also  perfected  title  by \nadverse possession and the plaintiff is not entitled to the \nrelief of partition. \n7.  Issue  No.4  was  answered  in  favour  of  the  first \ndefendant holding that the sales in favour of defendants 2 \nto 29 are valid and binding on the plaintiff and additional \nissue No.1 was answered in favour of the 14th defendant and \nadditional issue No.2 was answered as unnecessary as the \nplaintiff  was  not  entitled  to  claim  any  partition  in \nrespect of those properties and in the result, the suit was \ndismissed and aggrieved by the same, the present appeal is \nfiled. \n8.  It  is  submitted  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \nappellants that the court below, having found that the suit \n8\nproperties were included in the 'C' schedule in the earlier \npartition  of  the  year  1950,  ought  to  have  held  that  A \nschedule properties are the joint family properties of the \nplaintiff and the first defendant and they are the joint \nowners and there cannot be any adverse possession against \nthe  co-owner  and  the  Trial  Court,  without  properly \nappreciating the judgment reported in AIR 1981 SC 77 and \n1991 LW 296 cited by the plaintiff before the Trial Court, \nerred in holding that the plaintiff was not entitled to the \npartition.",

Public Prosecutor\n* * * * *\n2\nO R D E R\n(Order of the Court was made by V.Dhanapalan,J.)\nThe  prayer  in  the  Habeas  Corpus  Petition  is  to  direct  the \nrespondents to produce the detenu R.Munusamy, S/o.Ramachandran, Life \nConvict  with  CT  No.431/2008,  detained  at  Central  Prison,  Puzhal, \nThiruvallur District, before this Court and set him at liberty.\n2. Brief facts leading to filing of this petition are as follows:\n(a)  The  petitioner  is  the  wife  of  the  detenu  R.Munusamy \nS/o.Ramachandran.  He  was  born  on  10.09.1978.  Since  the  Birth \nCertificate of the detenu has not been obtained under Registration of \nBirths  and  Deaths  Act,  1969,  the  School  Transfer  Certificate  dated \n13.09.1993 and the Driving License dated 22.11.2005 have been relied \nupon to prove the age of the detenu and he was less than 18 years of age \non the date of occurrence of the alleged offence on 08.06.1996.\n(b)  The  detenu  was  implicated  as  third  accused  in  the  alleged \noffence  under  Section  302  r/w  34  IPC  said  to  have  taken  place  on \n08.06.1996; on the date of commission of the offence, the detenu was \naged about 17 years, 9 months and 28 days and thus, he was a juvenile as \n3\nper  Juvenile  Justice  (Care  and  Protection  of  Children)  Act,  2000,  as \namended (hereinafter referred to as 'the Act'), but he was tried as an \nadult  in  S.C.No.399  of  1998  on  the  file  of  the  learned  V  Additional \nSessions Judge, Chennai and was convicted and sentenced to undergo life \nimprisonment, by judgment dated 10.04.2001, which was confirmed by \nthis Court in Crl.A.No.425 of 2001, by a judgment dated 27.09.2005 and \nthereafter, the detenu continued to languish in Central Prison, Puzhal, \nThiruvallur District.\n(c) Section 7-A(1) of the Act, as amended by Act 33 of 2006, \nallows the claim of juvenility to be raised before any Court at any stage \nof the proceedings, even after disposal of the case, on the ground that \nthe accused was a juvenile on the date of commission of offence.\n(d) The  detenu  was  confined  at  Central  Prison,  Puzhal, \nThiruvallur District for about 11 years. The continued detention of the \ndetenu is unjust, illegal and violative of Article 21 of the Constitution of \nIndia. Hence, the petitioner has filed this petition.\n4\n3. Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the detenu \nwas a juvenile on the date of commission of offence, namely the date of \noccurrence and the detenu's date of birth is 10.09.1978 and the date of \noccurrence was 08.06.1996. It is his contention that in this regard, this \nCourt, by an order dated 14.03.2013, directed the trial Court to conduct \nan enquiry and give a report regarding the age of the detenu on the date \nof  occurrence.  Such  enquiry  report,  dated  26.04.2013  has  been \nsubmitted  by  the  learned  V  Additional  District  and  Sessions  Judge, \nChennai, which would clearly indicate that the detenu was a juvenile on \nthe date of occurrence. Learned counsel further stated that the detenu \nhas been in jail for more than 11 years and prayed that he is entitled to \nthe benefits of the Act and hence, he requested this Court to set him at \nliberty forthwith. In support of his case, he relied on various decisions of \nthis Court and the Supreme Court. \n4. On  the  above  submissions,  we  have  heard \nMr.A.N.Thambidurai, learned Additional Public Prosecutor appearing for \nthe  respondent.   He  submitted  that  the  Act  itself  is  a  beneficial \nLegislation  and  the  ratio  laid  down by  the  Supreme Court  in  various \ndecisions also makes it clear that if, on the date of occurrence, a detenu \n5\nwas a juvenile/minor and less than 18 years of age, he is entitled to the \nbenefits  of  the  Act  and  anyone  convicted  thereupon,  may  be  set  at \nliberty forthwith. While explaining the legal position, he would further \nsubmit that the detenu can claim the benefits only when he comes under \nthe definition of a Juvenile.\n5. We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the parties \nand perused the records and the enquiry report, dated 26.04.2013 of the \nlearned V Additional District and Sessions Judge, Chennai, in respect of \nthe  enquiry  conducted  in  S.C.No.399  of  1998  and  gone  through  the \nvarious decisions of the Supreme Court and this Court.\n6. On a circumspection of facts, it is seen that the petitioner is \nthe  wife  of  the  detenu  Munusamy.   According  to  her,  her  husband's \n(detenu's) date of birth is 10.09.1978. Since the Birth Certificate of the \ndetenu has not been obtained under Registration of Births and Deaths \nAct,  1969,  the  School  Transfer  Certificate  dated  13.09.1993  and  the \nDriving License dated 22.11.2005 have been relied upon to substantiate \nthe age of her husband, annexed in page Nos.1 and 34 of the typed set of \npapers filed along with this Habeas Corpus Petition.\n6\n7. To ascertain as to whether on the date of occurrence the \ndetenu was a juvenile or not, this Court, by an order dated 14.03.2013, \ndirected the Trial Court to conduct an enquiry and send a report and \naccordingly, the enquiry report dated 26.04.2013 was submitted to this \nCourt by the learned V Additional District and Sessions Judge, Chennai, in \nrespect of the enquiry conducted in S.C.No.399 of 1998, and the said \nenquiry report reads as follows:\n\"As  per  the  Hon'ble  High  Court's  direction  in  order  in \nHabeas Corpus Petition No.2173/2012 dated 14.03.2013, this  \nCourt  is  directed  to  determine  the  age  of  the  accused \nMunusamy  at  the  time  of  occurrence  dated  08.06.1996  in  \naccordance with law.\nThis case of Juvenility is coming on 22.04.2013 for final  \nhearing  before  this  Court  in  the  presence  of  Ms.Uma \nSriVardhini, Additional City Public Prosecutor for the State and \nof M/s.K.Selvaraj, V.Alamelu, counsel for the accused person \nMunusamy, after hearing the arguments of both sides and upon \nperusing the relevant records, evidences and material objects \nand having stood over for consideration till this day, this Court  \nhas delivered the following:\nORDER\n1.The point for consideration is:\nwhether the accused person Munusamy is a juvenile in \nconflict with law on the date of occurrence?\n7\n2.On  point: As  per  the  Hon'ble  High  Court  Order  in  \nHabeas Corpus Petition No. 2173 of 2012 dated 14.03.2013 as  \nthe learned V Additional Sessions Judge, Chennai is directed to  \nconduct an enquiry into determine the age of the accused at \nthe  time  of  commission  of  the  offence  i.e.  08.06.1996,  \naccordance with law, as per the  provisions laid down by the \nHon'ble  Apex  Court  in  the  decision  in  Hariram's  case  (cited \nsupra) reported in 2009 (13) SCC 211 and as per the rules and  \nprovisions  framed  under  the  Juvenile  Justice  Act  2000,  by \naffording  opportunity  to  the  accused  as  well  as  to  the \nprosecution.

It  is  true that the \n4\npetitioner had been appointed as a trainee for one year; Thereafter, no \nformal order for extension of training was issued to the petitioner; The \npetitioner was allowed to work even after one year training is over; \nThe  appraisal  report  (xerox)  of  the  petitioner  has  been  produced; \nEx.R.7 appraisal form does not contain the signature of the personal \ndepartment; The signature of the department was found in the report \nof R.7. Ex.R.6 contains the signature of both departmental seal and \npersonal department; In the column provided for putting signature of \nthe  personal  department,  the  department  personal  has  not  put  his \nsignature  in  Ex.R.7.  Hence,  the  appraisal  report  Ex.R.7  cannot  be \nrelied upon' and resultantly, held that the termination of service of the \npetitioner was not made in accordance with law and passed an Award \nholding that the non-employment of the petitioner  was not justified \nand  directed  the  Writ  Petitioner  (Management)  to  reinstate  the  2nd \nRespondent  (Petitioner  in  W.P.No.20416/2005)  into  service  within \nthree months after the receipt of the Award without backwages with \ncontinuity of service from 01.11.1999 and without other benefits.\n3.The Summary of Facts:\n(i)The  Petitioner/Company  registered  under  the  Indian \n5\nCompanies Act, 1956, is engaged in the business of manufacture and \nsale  of  automative  and  industrial  batteries  and  other  ancillary \nproducts.  Its  manufacturing  process  being  highly  sophisticated,  the \nsuccess of the candidates undergoing training would greatly depend \nupon their degree of skill and adaptability. Unless, a candidate after \nsuch training succeeds into the evaluation test, it is neither desirable \nnor is the intention of the Company to regularise such candidate and \nemploy in the production units. \n(ii)The Petitioner/Company, during the year 1997, recruited six \ncandidates  for  undergoing training on the  explicit  condition that  on \nsuccessful completion of the said training period and on succeeding in \nthe evaluation test they would be appointed as regular employees of \nthe Company. The 2nd Respondent (Petitioner in W.P.No.20416/2005) \nwas  given  an  offer  to  join  the  Petitioner/Company  as  'Production \nTrainee'  initially  for  a  period  of  one  year.  As  per  the  terms  and \nconditions  of  the said  appointment  as  a  Trainee,  he was  offered  a \ngross payment of Rs.2,300/- per month, which he was receiving from \nthe date of his joining.  In the said letter, it is also stated that  during \nthe period of training the service can be terminated at any time by \ngiving one month notice or in lieu of a month's consolidated stipend. \n6\nAdded  further,  it  was  mentioned  that  the  Management  at  its  sole \ndiscretion may extend the training period, if found necessary. It was \nan explicit term that the said offer would not confer on him any right \nto any employment in the organisation. After satisfactory completion of \nthe training period, however, he may be offered employment in the \norganisation  depending  on  the  availability  of  suitable  vacancy,  his \nperformance,  attendance,  application  to  work,  maintenance  of \ndiscipline during the period of training. As such, even after successful \ncompletion of the training, the trainee would not have any right to any \nemployment in the organisation and therefore, the employment in the \norganisation would depend on suitable vacancy and other facts.\n(iii)The 2nd Respondent although he was undergoing training at \nHosur Unit of the Petitioner/Company along with other five candidates \nwho joined more or less at the same time, he was found unable to \nkeep pace with the training programme. Further, he had shown lack of \ninterest and dedication to his work. After completion of such training \nfor an initial period of one year, his performance was appraised by the \nconcerned authority of the Petitioner/Company and on such appraisal, \nhe was found not suitable for regular employment. In the appraisal \nform,  the  concerned  authority  had  recommended  for  his  further \n7\ntraining. The appraisal form was duly signed by the officer who had \nevaluated the performance of the 2nd Respondent and also the Head \nOffice in which he was undergoing training. In fact, the comment on \nsuch  appraisal  form  by  the  officer  was  to  the  extent  that  the  2nd \nRespondent could be discontinued. However, on considering the fact \nthat  he  had  already  underwent  training  for  one  year,  it  was \nrecommended by the Head of the Department for an extended period \nof  training.  The  other  five  candidates  who  joined  the  Petitioner/ \nCompany as Trainees along with the 2nd Respondent had successfully \ncompleted  their  training  and  on  appraisal  being  found  suitable  for \nregular employment, they were taken on the rolls of the Company as \npermanent employees.\n(iv)The  2nd Respondent  was  receiving  the  monthly  stipend  of \nRs.2,300/- for the entire second year period of training and knowing \nfully well that he failed in the appraisal tests, he was working in the \nPetitioner/Company  as  Trainee.  On  completion  of  the  second  year \ntraining period, he was again appraised by the concerned authority of \nthe Company, when it was found that the 2nd Respondent, inspite of \nsuch  training  for  two  consecutive  years  could  not  succeed  in  the \nappraisal  test.  Further,  he was graded very poor  by the appraising \n8\nauthority.",

Respondents\n* * *\nPrayer in W.P.No.16780 of 2013 : Writ Petition is filed under Article 226 of \nthe Constitution of India praying for the issuance of writ of Mandamus directing \nthe respondents 1 to 4 to receive, process, consider and effect Electricity service \nconnection for the premises at Door No.85, G.S.T. Road, Tambaram, Chennai – \n45, comprised in Old Survey No.150/1A1J2, New T.S.No.22, Block No.33, Ward-B \n(as per TSLR Extract) of Kadaperi Village, Tambaram Municipality, in accordance \nwith  law  and  without  insisting  on  production  of  completion  Certificate/No \nObjection Certificate from the fifth respondent.\n* * *\nFor Petitioners in W.P. :  Mr.D.S.Rajasekaran\n No.16780 of 2013\nFor Respondents 1 to 4 : Mr.P.Gunaraj\n in W.P.No.16780/2013\nFor Respondent 5 : Mr.A.Kumar\n in W.P.No.16780/2013\nCOMMON   ORDER\nIn all these cases, the petitioners, who have put up construction, have \nsought  for  electricity  service  connection  to  the  newly  constructed  buildings \nwithout  insisting  Completion  Certificate  from  the  Chennai  Metropolitan \nDevelopment Authority (for short \"CMDA\").\n2. Hence, the issue that arises for consideration in all these cases is as to \nwhether  the  petitioners,  who  have  built  special  buildings/group \ndevelopments/multi-storeyed  buildings,  can  seek  electricity  service  connection \nwithout producing the completion certificate from the CMDA ?\n3\n3. This Court directed the CMDA to file Inspection Reports.  Based on the \nsame, Inspection Reports have been filed.\n4.1. According to the learned counsels for the petitioners, after coming \ninto force of  the Electricity  Act,  2003,  the electricity  board authorities  cannot \ninsist upon the production of completion certificate from the CMDA for effecting \nelectricity service connection. They relied on Section 43 (1) of the Electricity Act \nin this regard. \n4.2.  The learned counsels  also heavily  relied  on the judgments of  the \nlearned Single Judges of this Court dated 26.07.2012 made in W.P.No.2219 of \n2012,  dated 29.04.2013 made in W.P.Nos.5661 and 5662 of 2013 and dated \n30.04.2013 made in W.P.No.11649 of 2013 in support of their submissions that \nthe electricity service connection cannot be denied on the ground of want of \ncompletion certificate from the CMDA in view of the provisions of the Electricity \nAct and Distribution Code framed thereunder. \n4.3. Alternatively, the learned counsels for the petitioners submitted that \nthe First Bench of this Court dismissed a writ appeal preferred by the Electricity \nBoard in W.A.No.1102 of 2007 on 04.09.2007 in the matter of insisting upon the \ncompletion  certificate  from  the  CMDA  holding  that  there  were  only  minor \ndeviations. According to them the deviations in set back, car parking, FSI etc., \n4\nbarring floor violations, shall be termed as minor and the petitioners are, thus, \nentitled to electricity connection. \n4.4. The learned counsels also relied on another judgment of the Division \nBench dated 20.04.2009 in W.A.No.1368 of 2007 and submitted that only in the \ncase of floor deviation, the electricity connection could be denied and not in the \ncase of other deviations.  \n4.5. The learned counsels for the petitioners also relied on the another \norder of the learned Single Judge dated 01.08.2012 in W.P.Nos.3847 and 3848 \nof  2012,  wherein,  the  learned Single  Judge held  that  in  case of  major  floor \nviolation, the builder could not be entitled for electricity connection and in the \ncase of minor violation, electricity connection could not be denied and giving \ndirection  to  effect  electricity  connection  shall  not  bar  the  CMDA to take  any \naction for violation in the building in accordance with law.\n4.6. The learned counsels for the petitioners also brought to my notice the \norder of the Division Bench of this Court dated 02.01.2011 made in M.P.No.1 of \n2011  in  W.A.No.1251  of  2011  issuing  interim  direction  to  disconnect  water \nsupply and electricity  connection given to the premises  of  the writ  petitioner \ntherein. The said interim order was passed in the writ appeal preferred against \nthe order dated 18.09.2009 in W.P.No.17897 of 2009.  It is submitted that the \nsaid  order  of  the  Division  Bench  dated  02.01.2011  in  M.P.No.1  of  2011  in \nW.A.No.1251  of  2011  was  stayed  by  the  Apex  Court  in  the  order  dated \n5\n24.11.2011 in S.L.P.No.32557-32558 of 2011. Ultimately, the Apex Court allowed \nthe S.L.Ps. by the order dated 03.08.2012.\n5.1. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the CMDA has heavily \nrelied on the First Bench judgment of this Court in Consumer Action Group V. \nState of Tamil Nadu reported in 2006 (4) CTC 483 and has submitted that \nthe First Bench laid down the law that electricity and water connection shall be \nprovided to the building only on the production of the completion certificate from \nthe CMDA.  \n5.2. The learned counsel for the CMDA has also relied on Regulation 5(a) \nof the Development Regulations for Chennai Metropolitan Area notified in the \nSecond Master Plan for Chennai Metropolitan Area, 2006 which contemplates the \nproduction of completion certificate to put the building in use. \n5.3. It is submitted that the judgments of the learned Single Judges, relied \non by the petitioners,  do not refer to the First Bench judgment of this Court \nreported in 2006 (4) CTC 483.  \n5.4. It is submitted that after the judgment of the First Bench of this Court \nreported in  2006 (4) CTC 483,  completion certificate norms were made and \nthose norms provided for tolerance limit of deviations and only when this tolerant \nlimit is exceeded, completion certificate is denied.  That is, deviations to some \nextent are permitted as per the norms and when the deviations exceed these \n6\nnorms, completion certificate is denied. The learned counsel for the CMDA has \ntaken  serious  objection  for  describing  the  violations  relating  to  set  backs, \nviolation  relating  to  car  parking  and  violation  relating  to  FSI  etc.  as  minor \nviolations and the floor violation is only described as major deviation.  In this \nregard, learned counsel has brought to the notice of this Court paragraphs 12, 26 \nand 31 of the judgment of the First Bench of this Court reported in  2006 (4) \nCTC 483, wherein, the First Bench made it clear that these violations shall not \nbe condoned. \n5.5.  The  learned  counsel  also  submitted  that  the  judgment  dated \n04.09.2007  in  W.A.No.1102  of  2007  and  the  judgment  dated  20.04.2009  in \nW.A.No.1368 of 2007 shall be confined to the facts of those cases and those \njudgments cannot be understood as giving direction to the electricity authorities \nto  provide  electricity  connection  even  after  there  are  deviations  that  are \ndisapproved by the First Bench of this Court in paragraphs 12, 26 and 31 of the \njudgment reported in 2006 (4) CTC 483.\n5.6. The learned counsel has also submitted that the Apex Court in the \norder dated 03.08.2012 in S.L.P.Nos.32557-32558 of 2008 set aside the ex-parte \ninterim direction,  issued  by the  Division  Bench  of  this  Court,  without  notice, \ndisconnecting  the water  supply  and electricity  connection and the SLPs  were \ndisposed of directing the Division Bench to dispose of the writ appeal.",

These are the interesting questions involved \nin this writ petition. \n3\n2.The facts of the case are as follows:-\nMr.M.Chidambaranathan  (deceased  –  the  first  respondent \nherein) claimed that he was a cultivating tenant of the land comprised \nin  S.No.1111  at  Vikramasingapuram,  Ambasamudram  Taluk, \nTirunelveli  District,  measuring  0.68  acres.  According  to \nMr.M.Chidambaranathan, he had been in possession and enjoyment of \nthe suit property as a cultivating tenant for more than two decades. \nThe  land  admittedly,  belongs  to  the  Tamil  Nadu  Electricity  Board \n(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  TNEB”).  He  was  also  paying  rent \nregularly to the TNEB. \n3.While so, the Assistant Engineer (Civil), of TNEB, Papanasam \nissued a memo to  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan  calling upon him to hand \nover  vacant  possession of  the  land.  There  was  also  an attempt  to \ndispossess  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan  from  the  said  land.  Therefore, \nMr.M.Chidambaranathan filed a Civil Suit in O.S.No.300 of 1971 on the \nfile  of  the  learned  District  Munsif,  Ambasamudram  against  TNEB \nseeking a decree for permanent injunction to restrain the TNEB and its \nofficials  from interfering  with  his  possession  and  enjoyment  of  the \nproperty as the cultivating tenant and for other reliefs.\n4\n4.In the written statement filed before the Civil  Court,  it  was \ncontended  by  the  TNEB  that   Mr.M.Chidambaranathan  was  only  a \nlicensee and not a cultivating tenant. It was also contended that the \nlicence  was  cancelled  and  thereafter,   Mr.M.Chidambaranathan \ncontinued to occupy the said land only as a trespasser. By judgment \nand decree  dated 04.12.1972,  the  learned District  Munsif  however, \nheld that  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan was only a lessee and therefore, he \nwas entitled for decree for permanent injunction but not for the other \nreliefs prayed for. Accordingly, the learned District Munsif decreed the \nsuit, in part. \n5.As  against  the  said  decree  and  judgment  passed  by  the \nlearned District Munsif, the TNEB filed an appeal in A.S.No.12 of 1973. \nDuring the pendency of these proceedings,  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan \nfiled  a  separate  appeal  in  A.S.No.14  of  1973  before  the  learned \nSubordinate  Judge,  Tirunelveli,  in  respect  of  the reliefs  which were \ndenied by the learned District Munsif. The learned Subordinate Judge, \nTirunelveli by judgment and decree dated 31.01.1975, dismissed both \nthe above appeals thereby confirming the decree and judgment of the \ntrial Court. As against the said common decree and judgment of the \n5\nFirst Appellate Court, Second Appeals were filed before this Court in \nS.A.Nos.1811  &  1812  of  1975.  Both  the  Second  Appeals  were \ndismissed by this Court by judgment dated 28.04.1998.\n6.In the mean while,  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan filed a Form- V \napplication before the Record Officer under the Tamil Nadu Agricultural \nLands Record of Tenancy Rights Act, 1969 (Act X of 1969) (hereinafter \nreferred to as “the RTR Act”) seeking to record his name as a tenant \nunder the TNEB in the approved record of tenancy rights. Before the \nRecord Officer, the TNEB took a specific plea that the RTR Act, is not \napplicable to the lands belonging to the TNEB. It was also contended \nthat  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan was not entitled for the benefits under \nthe Tamil Nadu Cultivating Tenants Protection Act, 1955 (hereinafter \nreferred to as “the CTP Act’). The Record Officer, Ambasamudram in \nT.R.No.28/1994  negatived  the  said  contentions  of  the  TNEB  and \nordered  for  recording  the  name  of   Mr.M.Chidambaranathan  as  a \ntenant in the record of tenancy rights by order dated 18.10.1995. As \nagainst  the  same,  the  TNEB  filed  an  appeal  to  the  Sub-\nCollector/Appellate Authority under the RTR Act at Tirunelveli. Before \nthe Appellate Authority, the same plea was taken by the TNEB saying \nthat the RTR Act is not applicable to the lands belonging to the TNEB. \n6\nThe Appellate Authority by order dated 19.06.1997 in Appeal No.13/96 \ndismissed the said appeal thereby confirming the order of the Record \nOfficer. As against the same, the TNEB filed a statutory revision before \nthe District Revenue Officer, Tirunelveli. The District Revenue Officer \nby order dated 10.08.1999, in Revision No.3 of 1998, dismissed the \nsaid revision thereby confirming the order of the Record Officer. As \nagainst the same, the petitioner/TNEB is before this Court with this \nwrit petition.\n7.I have heard the learned counsel for the petitioners and the \nlearned Special Government Pleader appearing for the respondents 2 \nto  4.  During  the  pendency  of  these  proceedings, \nMr.M.Chidambaranathan/  the  first  respondent  herein  died  and \ntherefore, the respondents 5 and 6 herein have been impleaded as the \nlegal representatives of the first respondent. But the respondents 5 & \n6 have not made appearance before this Court though notices were \nserved on them.\n8.The  fact  that,  Mr.M.Chidambaranathan  and  his  legal \nrepresentatives  have  been  in  possession  and  enjoyment  of  the \nproperty cannot be disputed at this length of time in view of the earlier \n7\ncivil litigation which came up to this Court by way of Second Appeals in \nS.A.Nos.1811 & 1812 of 1975. The plea of TNEB before the Civil Court \nthat Mr.M.Chidambaranathan was only a licensee was negatived. It has \nbeen ultimately held by the Civil Court that Mr.M.Chidambaranathan \nwas only a lessee of the said property. Therefore, it is not open for the \nTNEB now to contend that Mr.M.Chidambaranathan is only a licensee \nand since the licence was cancelled, as of now, he is only a trespasser. \nThe respondents 5 and 6 being the legal representatives of deceased \nMr.M.Chidambaranathan, claim to be in possession and enjoyment of \nthe property in question and now, they are cultivating the said land \ncontributing their physical labour and therefore, it cannot be denied \nthat they are the tenants of the said land, as the said decision has \nonce for all become final. \n9.With the above factual  background, the interesting question \nnow to be decided is “whether the RTR Act is applicable to the lands \nbelonging to the TNEB”. The learned counsel for the petitioners would \nrely on Section 19 of the RTR Act to substantiate his contention that \nthe lands belonging to the TNEB are exempted from the purview of the \nsaid  Act.  For  better  understanding,  Section  19  of  the  RTR  Act  is \nextracted below:-\n8\n“19.Exemption,-Nothing contained in this \nAct  shall  apply  to  any  land  owned  by  the \nCentral Government or any State Government, \nor any local authority.\nExplanation.-In  this  section  ‘local \nauthority’ means-\n(a)the Corporation of Madras;\n(b)any municipal Council;\n(c)any  panchayat  or  panchayat  union \nCouncil  constituted  or  deemed to  have  been \nconstituted under the Tamil Nadu Panchayats \nAct, 1958 (Tamil Nadu Act XXXV of 1958);\n(d)any  township  committee  constituted \nor deemed to have been constituted under any \nlaw for the time being in force; and\n(e)the Tamil Nadu State Housing Board \nconstituted  under  the  Tamil   Nadu  State \nHousing Board Act, 1961 (Tamil Nadu Act XVII \nof 1961).”\n10.A perusal of Section 19 of the RTR Act would go to show that \nthere is no specific mention about the exemption of lands belonging to \nthe TNEB. The said provision only exempts the lands belonging to the \nCentral government or any State Government or any local authority. \nAdmittedly, the TNEB is not a local authority as explained in Section 19 \n9\nof the Act and therefore, in my considered opinion, Section 19 does \nnot exempt the lands belonging to the TNEB from the purview of the \nAct.",

Respondents  \nWrit Petition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India, \nto issue a Writ of Certiorarified Mandamus, to call for the records in \npursuant to the impugned order passed by the second respondent in \nProc.Na.Ka.113/B.Pitchiah, dated 10.10.2003, and the Appellate Order \npassed  by  the  first  respondent  in  Rc.No.44640/2003/D2,  dated \n16.07.2004  and  quash  these  orders  and  consequently  direct  the \nrespondents  to  repay  the  amount  already  recovered  from  the \npetitioner with interest.    \n For Petitioner  : Mr.S.M.Subramaniam\nFor Respondents   :     Mr.R.Rajeswaran\nSpecial Government Pleader\nfor first respondent\nMr.P.Srinivas  \nfor second respondent    \nO R D E R  \n2\nThe present Writ Petition has been filed challenging the order of \nthe  second  respondent,  dated  10.10.2003,  confirmed  by  the  first \nrespondent, by  order dated 16.07.2004.  \n2.  The  petitioner  is  working  as  Senior  Clerk  in  the  second \nrespondent  Spinning  Mill.  He  was  placed  under  suspension  on \n02.08.2002, in pursuant to an audit objection. Consequently, a charge \nmemo was issued by the second respondent on 10.08.2002 stating \nthat in the year 1992-93 certain goods, which were purchased for the \nMill, were not brought inside the campus by the petitioner. Thereupon, \nafter  conducting  an  enquiry,  an  order  came  to  be  passed  on \n10.10.2003 by the second respondent,  whereby,  the petitioner  was \ndirected to repay the amount of Rs.37,238.75 in eleven instalments, \nbeing the value of the said goods purchased and not brought inside the \ncampus. The said order was challenged by the petitioner before the \nRevisional  Authority,  viz.,  the  first  respondent.  The  Revisional \nAuthority  concurred  with  the  finding of  the  second respondent  and \nrejected the revision by holding that being the Administrative Head, \nthe second respondent is empowered to order for recovery of the sum \nfrom the petitioner  and such order  is  well  within his administrative \n3\npowers. Challenging the said proceedings, the petitioner has filed the \npresent Writ Petition before this Court.\n3. I have heard the learned counsel on either side and I have \nalso perused the records carefully.\n4.  The  only  contention  raised  by  the  learned counsel  for  the \npetitioner  before  this  Court  is  that  the   second  respondent  is  not \nempowered under the Tamil Nadu Co-operative Societies Act, to pass \nthe order of recovery and therefore,  the impugned order is without \njurisdiction.  According  to  the  learned  counsel,  they  should  have \nproceeded  only  under  Section  87  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Co-operative \nSocieties Act, for recovery of the amount and instead of doing so, the \npresent impugned order cannot be passed by the second respondent. \nThe learned counsel for the petitioner further submitted that if at all a \npunishment can be imposed, it can be  in the form of dismissal from \nservice or reduction in rank or withholding of increment etc., and not \nfor recovery of the money.\n5.  Per  contra,  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  second \nrespondent  supported  the  impugned  order  by  stating  that  the \n4\nimpugned order came to be passed well within the powers conferred \non the authorities.  \n6. I have considered the above submissions.\n7. First of all, it is to be noted that before passing the impugned \norder, the second respondent had given adequate opportunity to the \npetitioner  by  issuing  charge  memo and calling  for  explanation  and \nthereafter, conducting an enquiry. Therefore, it cannot be said that an \nopportunity of being heard was denied to the petitioner.  After giving \ndue opportunity of hearing and after finding him guilty of the charge \nleveled against the petitioner, the impugned order of recovery came to \nbe  passed.  It  is  seen  that  the  petitioner  was  directed  to  pay  the \namount  of  Rs.37,238.75  in  eleven  instalments.  The  charge  leveled \nagainst  the  petitioner,  which  is  found to  be  proved,  is  that  having \npurchased the material for the Mill to the value of the said sum, he has \nnot brought the same into the factory campus. Thus, in effect,  the \npetitioner instead of bringing the materials into the factory campus, \nhas misappropriated the same.  The impugned order, in fact, referred \nas if the petitioner should have been removed from service for the act \ncommitted  by  him.  However,  taking  a  lenient  view,  the  second \n5\nrespondent  has  only  passed  the  order  of  recovering  the  money  in \neleven instalments. In my considered view, based on certain technical \nobjections, the petitioner cannot escape from the liability to repay the \nmoney.  He should thank the second respondent for not dismissing him \nfrom service. Therefore, I am of the view that the order of the second \nrespondent, which has been confirmed by the first respondent, does \nnot warrant any interference at the hands of this Court.\n8.  In  the  result,  this  Writ  Petition  is  devoid  of  merits  and \ntherefore, the same is dismissed.

He  retired  from  service  on \n30.09.2010.    The first  respondent  passed an order  of  recovery of \nRs.81,566 by an order dated 14.10.2010.\n2.  The  petitioner  took  up  the  matter  before  the  second \nrespondent against the aforesaid order under Section 90 of the Tamil \nNadu  Co-operative  Societies  Act  1983  which  was  rejected  by  the \nsecond respondent by an order dated 30.05.2012.  \n3.  Realising  the  mistake  that  the  second  respondent  has  no \njurisdiction to decide the service matters,  the petitioner  has filed a \nRevision Petition dated 3.11.2012 under Section 153 of the Tamil Nadu \nCo-operative Societies Act before the third respondent.\n4.The  third  respondent  passed  the  impugned  order  dated \n22.7.2013 dismissing the Revision Petition on the sole ground that the \npetitioner should have filed an appeal under Section 152 of the Tamil \n3\nNadu Co-operative Societies Act before the appellate authority against \nthe order of the second respondent dated 30.05.2012 that was passed \nunder Section 90 of the Act.   The petitioner has filed this Writ Petition \nto quash the order dated 22.07.2013 and for a direction to the third \nrespondent to dispose of the Revision Petition dated 03.11.2012 under \nSection 153 of the Act on merits.\n5. Heard both sides.\n6.  The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  has  relied  on  the \njudgment of this Court dated 02.02.2012 in W.P.No.2384 of 2012 \nin V.Venkataraman  vs.  The  Thiruvannamalai  District  Co-\noperative Bank Ltd., rep. by its Specil Officer, Thiruvannamalai \nDistrict.\n7. In my considered view the said judgment squarely applies to \nthe facts of this case.   The said judgment is based on the decision of a \nDivision Bench of this Court in  P.Eswaramoorthy and others Vs. \nR.J.B.Leoraj  and  others  reported  in  2008  5  MLJ  238.    The \njudgment  is  of  short  one  and  the  entire  judgment  is  extracted \nhereunder:-\n4\nO R D E R\n\"The  writ  petitioner  is  working  as  a  Field \nManager  in  the  respondent  Bank.   In  this  writ \npetition, he has come forward to challenge the order \npassed by the Cooperative Tribunal, Tiruvannamalai \ncum  District  Court,  Tiruvannamalai  in \nC.T.A.No.10/2003 dated 30.11.2010.  \n2. The Tribunal by its order dated 30.11.2010 \nrefused  to  entertain  the  appeal  made  by  the \npetitioner  under  Section  152  of  the  Cooperative \nSocieties  Act  challenging  the  order  passed  by  the \nSub-  Registrar  in  Arbitral  proceedings  made  in \nA.R.C.No.617/98-99  dated  27.08.2003.   The \nTribunal held that the relief claimed by the petitioner \nis entirely covered by the settlement under Section \n12(3)  of  the  Industrial  Disputes  Act,  1947  dated \n20.02.1997.  \n3. It transpires that the petitioner claimed in \nhis Arbitration Proceedings initiated under Section 90 \nof the Cooperative Societies Act a sum of Rs.8,022/- \ntowards monthly travel allowance for the period from \nMarch  1997  to  December  1997.   The  Arbitrator \nrejected the case of the petitioner vide order dated \n27.08.2003.  It was challenging the said order, the \nappeal  under  Section  152  of  the  Cooperative \nSocieties Act was filed. \n5\n4.  It  is  not  clear  as  to  why  the  petitioner \nmoved  the  Arbitrator  in  respect  of  his  service \nconditions  in  the  Cooperative  Society.   Such  an \narbitration  under  Section  90  of  the  Cooperative \nSocieties Act is not maintainable as Section 90 of the \nCooperative  Societies  Act  itself  excludes  any \narbitration in the matter of service conditions of an \nemployee in the Cooperative Society.  Therefore, the \npetitioner's  mere  application  before  the  Arbitrator \nitself is without jurisdiction.  The filing of appeal as \nagainst the order before the Tribunal is not valid.  \n5.  A  division  bench of  this  Court  headed by \nP.K.Misra,  J.  (as  he  then  was)  vide  judgment  in \nP.Eswaramoorthy and others Vs.   R.J.B.Leoraj  \nand others reported in  2008 5 MLJ 238 Madras \nhas  held  that  in  such  matters,  the  employee  will \nhave  remedy  by  way  of  Section  153  of  the \nCooperative  Societies  Act  or  before  any  other \nappropriate forum outside the Act.  \n6.  In  such  circumstances,  the  writ  petition \nitself  is  not  maintainable  and  the  arbitration \nproceedings initiated by him in A.R.C.No.617/98-99 \nis  also  not maintainable.   Hence,  the writ  petition \nstands  dismissed.   However,  since  the \npetitioner moved the forum without jurisdiction, it is \n6\nopen  to  him  to  institute  appropriate  proceedings \nbefore  the  appropriate  authority.  No  costs.\" \n8. In view of the above judgment, the impugned order is set \naside and the matter is remitted back to the third respondent to decide \nthe Revision Petition of the petitioner dated 03.11.2012 received by \nhim on 05.11.012 on merits and in accordance with law.    The third \nrespondent is  directed to pass final  orders  within a period of  three \nmonths from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.    Accordingly, \nthe Writ Petition is allowed.   No costs.\n                                                                   29.08.2013\nIndex   : yes/no.\nInternet: yes/no.\nasvm\nTo\n1.570 The Thiruvannamalai Co-op.Urban Bank Ltd.,\n   T.V.Malai 606601 rep by its Board of Directors,\n   through the President.\n2.The Deputy Registrar of Co-op.Societies,\n   Thiruvannamalai Circle, Thiruvannamalai.\n3.The Joint Registrar of Co-op.Societies,\n   Thiruvannamalai Region, Thiruvannamalai.\n7\nD.HARIPARANTHAMAN, J\n(asvm)\nW.P.No.24119 of 2013\n29.08.2013\n",

They filed this Writ \nPetition seeking for a declaration to declare that the action of the third \nrespondent in engaging contractor/contract employees or employees \nwho had gone on Voluntary Retirement Scheme to do the skilled work \nis contrary to G.O.(Ms)No.110, Industries (MIC.1) Department, dated \n7.8.2010.\n2.  The  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  petitioners  has \nsubmitted that the third respondent Mill is a Co-Operative Society Mill. \nThe Mill was closed due to financial difficulties and thereafter, the Mill \nwas revived by the Government by pumping huge amount.   In these \ncircumstances,  the  Government  issued  G.O.(Ms)No.110,  Industries \n3\n(MIC.1)  Department,  dated  7.8.2010  issuing  certain  directions. \nAccording to the petitioners, as per the directions contained in the said \nG.O.,  the  third  respondent  Mill  cannot  employ  contract  labours  or \nemployees who went under VRS.\n3. On the other hand, the learned Additional Government Pleader \nappearing  for  the  respondents  has  submitted  that  there  is  no \nprohibition in  G.O.(Ms)No.110, Industries (MIC.1) Department, dated \n7.8.2010, relied on by the petitioners to engage contract labourers. \nThe contract system is permitted and the same is not totally abolished \nin law.   If at all, any person is aggrieved over the contract system, \nsuch  person  should  approach  the  competent  authority  under  the \nContract  Labour  Regulation  and  Abolition  Act,  1970.    Thus,  the \npetitioners have no jurisdiction to question the employment of contract \nlabourers by the third respondent Mill.\n4.  The  learned  Additional  Government  Pleader  has  also \nsubmitted that all the employees in the third respondent  went on VRS \ndue to closure of the Mill and the closure was due to serious financial \ncrisis.   At that time when the Mill was closed, it was thought that the \nMill  could  not  be  revived  and  when  the  Mill  was  revived  by  the \n4\nassistance  of  the  Government,  the  erstwhile,  employees  who  went \nunder  VRS  and  who  are  within  58  years,  cannot  be  denied  fresh \nemployment.\n5. I have considered the submissions made by either side.   I \nhave perused G.O.(Ms)No.110, Industries (MIC.1) Department, dated \n7.8.2010.   The petitioners have relied on Para 5(e) which reads as \nfollows:-\n\"5  (e)  The  Commissioner  of  Sugar  is \nrequested to issue suitable instructions to the \nMadurantakam Co-Operative Sugar Mills Ltd., \nto re-deploy the employees from other sugar \nmills  where  there  are  excess  staff/workers \ninstead of going for 100% fresh recruitment.\"\n6. In my considered view, Para 5(e) of the said G.O. does not \nprevent the third respondent Sugar Mill from employing the contract \nlabourers or the employees who went under VRS.   It is not in dispute \nthat all  the employees in the third respondent Mill  went under VRS \nwhen the Mill was closed due to financial crisis.   The Mill was revived \ndue  to  financial  assistance  from  the  Government.    In  these \ncircumstances, there is nothing wrong in giving fresh employment to \n5\nthe persons who went under VRS.   Those employees have possessed \nrequired skill to handle the work and they have rich experience.    If a \npublic  sector  undertaking  is  closed  and  employees  are  retrenched, \nemployees  who  are  given  some  benefits  like  VRS,  are  also \naccommodated in some other  public  sector undertakings by way of \nGovernment  Orders.    Therefore,  there  is  nothing  wrong  in \naccommodating the employees, who went under VRS, particularly, if \nthey are below the age of retirement.  \n7. Hence, I do not find any merit in the Writ Petition.   The Writ \nPetition fails and the same is dismissed.  The connected Miscellaneous \nPetition is closed.  No costs.\n                                                                         30.08.2013\nIndex   : yes/no.\nInternet: yes/no.\nasvm\nTo\n1.The Government of Tamil Nadu,\n   rep. by its Principal Secretary,\n   Industries Department,\n   Fort St.George,\n   Chennai – 60 009.\n2.The Commissioner of Sugars,\n   No.690, Anna Salai,\n   Chennai – 600 035.\n6\nD.HARIPARANTHAMAN, J\n(asvm)\n3.Management,\n   Madurantagam Co-operative Sugar Mills,\n   Padalam,\n   Kancheepuram District.\nW.P.No.24367 of 2013\nand\nM.P.No.1 of 2013\n30.08.2013\n",

Mr.W.M.Abdul Majeed\nFor Respondents ... Mr.P.L.Narayanan\n2\nJ U D G M E N T\nDefendant Nos.2 to 8 in the Original Suit are the appellants in \nthe second appeal. The plaintiffs 1 to 4 in the Original Suit are the \nrespondents 1 to 4 in the second appeal. The first respondent Baby \nAmmal  is  no  more.  On the  death  of  the  first  respondent,  the  5th \nrespondent  Mohandas  Reddiar  has  been  impleaded  as  the  legal \nrepresentative of the deceased first respondent Baby Ammal by order \ndated 11.04.2012 made in M.P.No.4/2012. Respondents 1 to 4 in the \nsecond  appeal  filed  the  suit  O.S.No.1883/2004  on  the  file  of  the \nDistrict  Munsif  Court,  Vellore  for  declaration  of  title  to  the  suit \nproperty, recovery of  vacant possession and for mesne profits. The \nsuit was dismissed by the trial court without cost by its judgment and \ndecree dated 03.02.2008. On an appeal preferred by the respondents \n1  to  4  (plaintiffs)  in  A.S.No.9/2009  on  the  file  of  the  Sub  Court, \nVellore, the learned Subordinate Judge reversed the judgment of the \ntrial court and decreed the suit with cost regarding the prayers for \ndeclaration  and  recovery  of  possession.  The  learned  Subordinate \nJudge  has  also  found  the  plaintiffs  entitled  to  recover  a  sum  of \nRs.700/- per month as mesne profits from the date of filing of the suit \ntill delivery of possession. Since the first defendant is no more, the \nother defendants, namely defendants 2 to 8 have chosen to file the \npresent second appeal challenging the decree of the lower appellate \n3\ncourt reversing the decree passed by the trial court.  For the sake of \nconvenience, the parties shall be referred to in accordance with their \nranks in the Original Suit and at necessary places, description of the \nparties with their ranks in the second appeal shall be provided.\n2.  The  Original  Suit  was  filed  on  the  basis  of  the  plaint \naverments, which are in brief, as follows:\n        The  suit  property  was  purchased  by  Hamsaveni  Ammal,  the \nmother  of  Baby  Ammal  (first  plaintiff)  as  a  vacant  site  under  a \nregistered sale deed dated 27.08.1958. Hamsaveni Ammal, in turn, \nsold it to the first defendant S.M.Duraisamy Reddiar (since deceased), \nwho was  none  other  than her  husband and the  father  of  the  first \nplaintiff, under a registered sale deed dated 16.12.1960. The deceased \nfirst defendant S.M.Duraisamy Reddiar took a loan of Rs.10,000/- from \nVellore Town Co-operative Building Society and constructed a building. \nThereafter  he  executed  a  registered  Settlement  Deed  dated \n15.12.1962 conferring life interest on Hamsaveni Ammal and after the \ndeath of Hamsaveni Ammal in favour of the first plaintiff Baby Ammal \nand conferring absolute title on the plaintiffs 2 to 4, who would get it \nafter the death of the first plaintiff subject to the life interest created \nin  favour  of  Hamsaveni  Ammal  and  the  first  plaintiff.   The  said \nS.M.Duraisamy Reddiar died in or about 1973. Thereafter Hamsaveni \nAmmal also died on 14.01.1993. On the death of Hamsaveni Ammal, \n4\nthe first plaintiff Baby Ammal (since deceased) got the property to be \nenjoyed till her death without causing any alienation or encumbrance. \nAfter  the  death  of  Hamsaveni  Ammal,  possession  of  the  property \nshould have gone to the first plaintiff, but the first defendant, who was \nresiding with  Hamsaveni  Ammal  continued  to  be  in  possession.  As \nsuch the property and the original title deed would be deemed to be in \nhis  illegal  possession.  The  plaintiffs  1  to  4  approached  the  first \ndefendant  after  the  death  of  Hamsaveni  Ammal  and  asked him to \nvacate  and  hand  over  possession  of  the  suit  property.  But  the \ndeceased  first  defendant  was  evading  the  same.  Hence  the  first \nplaintiff was constrained to issue a legal notice dated 15.08.1994 to \nthe first defendant demanding delivery of vacant possession of the suit \nproperty to the first plaintiff and also claiming damages for use and \noccupation at the rate of Rs.750/- per month. The first defendant gave \na false reply on 12.09.1994 alleging that he got the property by virtue \nof  a  registered  Will  executed  by  his  mother,  namely  Hamsaveni \nAmmal. Hamsaveni Ammal did not have any alienable right in the suit \nproperty.  The  first  defendant  having  attested  the  Settlement  Deed \nexecuted by S.M.Duraisamy Reddiar is estopped from setting up an \nabsolute title in Hamsaveni Ammal to be derived by him from her by \nvirtue of her Will. Hence the plaintiffs are constrained to file the suit \nfor declaration of their title, recovery of possession and also recovery \nof damages for use and occupation.\n5\n3.  The  deceased  first  defendant,  who  was  originally  the  sole \ndefendant,  filed  a  written  statement  containing  the  following \naverments:\n        The first defendant’s mother’s mother Bangarammal inherited a \nlot of properties at Thuthipattu and Ariyur villages from her husband. \nShe executed a partition deed in 1953 in favour of the first plaintiff, \nthe first  defendant  and his brother.  At  that  point  of  time, the first \ndefendant  and  the  first  plaintiff  were  minors  and  their  mother \nHamsaveni  Ammal acted as guardian for  the execution of  the said \nPartition Deed. Thus Hamsaveni Ammal got the landed properties and \nshe was deriving a lot of income from the said properties. Out of the \nincome derived from the said properties, Hamsaveni Ammal purchased \nthe suit property in the year 1958. Her husband Duraisamy Reddiar, \nwho was the father of both the plaintiff and the first defendant, was \nnot having any income and he was maintained by Hamsaveni Ammal. \nWhen she wanted to put up a house in the property purchased by her \nand  when  she  approached  the  Vellore  Town  Co-operative  Building \nSociety for a loan, the same was declined stating that loans would not \nbe  given  to  female  applicants.  Hence  she  executed  the  sham and \nnominal  sale  deed  in  the  year  1960  in  favour  of  her  husband \nDuraisamy Reddiar so as to enable him to get a loan from the above \nsaid society. Duraisamy Reddiar obtained a loan of Rs.10,000/- from \nVellore Town Cooperative Building Society by creating a mortgage in \n6\nfavour of the Society in respect of the suit vacant site and with the \nhelp  of  the  loan  amount,  he  constructed  the  house  in  which \nHamsaveni Ammal and her husband were living together till the death \nof her husband Duraisamy Reddiar. Since the sale deed executed in \nfavour  of  Duraisamy  Reddiar  was  sham  and  nominal,  no  title  or \ninterest  was  acquired  by  him and  the  title  continued  to  vest  with \nHamsaveni  Ammal.  As  the  loan  obtained  from   Vellore  Town \nCooperative  Building Society  was not  discharged,  the  property  was \nbrought for sale in 1982 and at that point of time Hamsaveni Ammal \npaid a sum of  Rs.11,563.54P to the Society and got the mortgage \ndischarged. Since Hamsaveni Ammal did not treat the sale deed in \nfavour of her husband as a real transaction, she treated the property \nas her own and the same was the reason why she executed a Will \ndated 02.12.1992 in favour of the first defendant bequeathing the suit \nproperty  along  with  other  properties.  Hamsaveni  Ammal  died  on \n14.11.1993 due to heart attack. After her death, the Will was probated \nby the District Judge, Vellore on 16.12.1993.",

Nos. 546, 547, 549 and 550 of 2001 respectively on \nthe file of the VIII Small Causes cum learned Rent Control Appellate Authority, \nChennai confirming the judgment and decree dated 19.04.2011 passed in RCOP \nNo. 2546, 2547, 2549 and 2550 of 1997 respectively on the file of the learned X \nJudge, Court of Small Causes, Chennai.\n2. The revision petitioner has filed RCOP Nos. 2546, 2547, 2549 and \n2550 of 1997 respectively before the learned Rent Controller under Section 14 \n(1)  (b)  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Buildings  (Lease  and  Rent  Control)  Act,  1960, \nhereinafter referred to as 'The Act'  praying to issue appropriate direction to the \nrespondents/tenants to quit and deliver vacant possession of the shops under \n4\ntheir occupation.  The Rent Control Original Petitions have been contested by \nthe tenants. The learned Rent Controller ultimately dismissed the Rent Control \nOriginal Petition Nos.  2546, 2547, 2549 and 2550 of 1997 filed by the revision \npetitioner/landlord  on  19.04.2011.  Aggrieved  by  the  same,  the  revision \npetitioner/landlord filed RCA Nos. 546, 547, 549 and 550 of 2001 respectively. \nThe Rent Control Appeals have also been dismissed which resulted in the filing \nof the present Civil Revision Petitions.\n3. Before the learned Rent Controller, common evidence was let in in \nall  the cases.   On behalf  of  the landlord/revision petitioner,  it  was contended \nbefore the learned Rent Controller that the building in question is 75 years old \nand  it  is  in  a  dilapidated  condition  warranting  immediate  demolition.   Before \ninstituting the Rent Control Original Petitions, the landlord/revision petitioner has \nsent a notice dated 20.03.1997 seeking eviction of the tenants/respondents for \nwhich a reply notice dated 10.04.1997 was sent by them denying the request of \nthe landlord/revision petitioner.  Before the Rent Controller, a Civil Engineer was \nalso appointed to ascertain the age and condition of the building, but he was \nprevented by the tenants/respondents from inspecting the building. It was also \ncontended  on  behalf  of  the  landlord/revision  petitioner  that  the  tenants/ \nrespondents are paying a meager amount as rent and in order to augment the \nincome of the landlord by putting the building a commercial complex, eviction of \nthe tenants are necessary.  \n4. The tenants/respondents herein have contested the Rent Control \nOriginal Petitions by stating that in the building, there is an inscription indicating \nthat the building was constructed only during the year 1938 and therefore, as on \n5\nthe date of instituting the Rent Control Original Petitions, the building in question \nis  less  than  75  years  and  not  as  claimed  by  the  landlord/revision  petitioner \nherein.  It was also claimed that the landlord/revision petitioner did not produce \nany  building  plan  approved  by  the  competent  authority  and  therefore,  the \nrequirement  of  the  landlord/revision  petitioner  cannot  be  construed  as  a \nbonafide, but malafide.  \n5. The learned Rent Controller, accepting the arguments advanced by \nthe tenants/respondents, held that the landlord/revision petitioner failed to prove \nthat  the age of  the building is 75 years old warranting immediate demolition. \nEven though it was alleged that the Civil Engineer appointed on behalf of the \nlandlord/revision petitioner was not allowed to inspect the building in question, \nthe landlord/revision petitioner has failed to take appropriate steps in that behalf. \nThe learned Rent Controller also found that the landlord/revision petitioner has \nfailed to prove the age of the building and that it warrants immediate demolition \nand  therefore,  the  petitions  filed  by  the  landlord/revision  petitioner  were \ndismissed.  Such a view taken by the learned Rent Controller was also accepted \nby the learned Appellate Authority which resulted in the dismissal of  the Rent \nControl Appeals.\n6. The learned counsel appearing for the landlord/revision petitioners \nwould vehemently contend that the landlord/revision petitioner need not prove \nthat the building is in a dilapidated condition.  If the intention of the landlord is \nbonafide to put his property in to optimum possible use, the Court can direct the \neviction  of  the  tenants.   In  this  context,  the  learned counsel  for  the  revision \npetitioner also relied on the decision of the Honourable Supreme Court reported \n6\nin (S. Venugopal vs. A. Karuppusami and another) AIR 2006 SC 1930 and \n(Harrington House School vs. S.M. Ispahani and another) AIR 2002 SC 2268 \nto  contend  that  the  landlord  shall  submit  plans  for  approval  of  the  building \nconstruction sanctioned by the local authorities only during the execution stage. \nThe  learned  counsel  for  the  revision  petitioners  further  contended  that  even \naccording  to  the  tenants/respondents  herein,  there  is  an  inscription  in  the \nbuilding which indicate that the building was constructed in the year 1938 and if \nthat  is taken into consideration,  now the age of  the building is more than 75 \nyears.  In fact, the landlord/revision petitioner took steps to appoint  an Engineer \nand he was prevented by the respondents/tenants from inspecting the building in \nquestion.   Therefore,  the Engineer appointed by the petitioner,  based on the \navailable records, deposed that the age of the building is more than 75 years \nrecords.  While so, the courts below ought to have taken judicial of the age of the \nbuilding instead of shifting the burden on the revision petitioner for not taking \nsteps to enable the Civil Engineer to visit the building in question.  In any event, \nthe requirement of the landlord/revision petitioner is bonafide and he prayed for \nallowing the Revision Petitions.  \n7. On the contrary, the learned counsel for the tenants/respondents \nwould contend that the landlord/revision petitioner has not stepped into the box \nand deposed about the age and nature of the building.  It is only the power agent \nof  the  petitioner  who stepped  into  the  box and  deposed  about  the  age and \ncondition of the building in question.  The landlord/revision petitioner also did not \nfile the building plan approval for consideration of the Court.  While so, both the \nCourts below have concurrently held that the landlord/revision petitioner herein \ndid  not  prove that  the  requirement  of  the building in  question  is bonafide  as \n7\ncontemplated under Section 14 (1) (b) of the Act and he prayed for dismissal of \nthe revision petitions.",

Petrol Pump\nKarur-639 002 .. Appellant\nVs.\n1.Ravi @ Ravichandran\n2.N.K.M.Meera Hussain .. Respondents \nCivil  Miscellaneous  Appeal  filed  under  Section  173  of  the \nMotor  Vehicles  Act,  1988  against  the  judgment  and  decree  in \nM.C.O.P.No.300 of  2008 dated 29.12.2010 on the file  of  the Motor \nAccidents Claims Tribunal, Additional District Court, Fast Track Court \nNo.4, Ponneri.\nFor Appellants : Mr.N.Vijayaraghavan\nFor Respondent : Mr.F.Terry Chellaraja\n J U D G M E N T\n2\nM/s.Cholamandalam  MS  General  Insurance  Co  Ltd,  which \nfigured as the 2nd respondent in M.C.O.P.No.300 of 2008 before the \nMotor Accidents Claims Tribunal (Fast Track Court No.4), Ponneri is the \nappellant in the civil miscellaneous appeal. \n2. The first respondent herein made a claim against the 2nd \nrespondent herein and the appellant herein for compensation for the \ninjuries sustained by him in a motor accident that allegedly took place \non 06.04.2008, in which the vehicle bearing Registration No.TN-72 X-\n5545 belonging to the 2nd respondent herein was involved. He made a \nclaim as against the 2nd respondent as well  as the appellant on the \npremise that as on the date of accident, there was a valid insurance \ncoverage,  as  the  appellant  had issued an insurance  certificate.  The \nappellant  insurance  company,  who  figured  as  the  2nd respondent, \ncontested the MCOP on the limited ground that the appellant was not \nliable to reimburse the owner of the vehicle, as there was no insurance \npolicy issued by the appellant in force as on the date of accident. The \nTribunal, however disbelieved the said contention and chose to pass an \naward holding the appellant insurance company jointly and severally \nliable  with  the  2nd respondent  to  pay  the  compensation  amount \nawarded by the Tribunal to the first respondent herein/claimant. As \nagainst the said award, the present civil miscellaneous appeal has been \n3\nfiled  not  in  respect  of  the  quantum  of  compensation,  but  only  in \nrespect of the liability of the insurance company, namely the appellant.\n3. The arguments advanced by Mr.N.Vijayaraghavan, learned \ncounsel for the appellant and by Mr.F.Terry Chellaraja, learned counsel \nfor the respondent are heard. The materials available on record are \nalso perused.\n4.  The  short  question  that  arises  for  consideration  in  this \nappeal is \n\"whether  the  Tribunal  was  right  in  holding that \nthere was a valid insurance policy in force as on the date of \naccident and that the appellant was the insurer who issued \nthe insurance certificate?\"\n5.  In  this  regard,  it  is  pertinent  to  note  that  the  insured, \nnamely the 2nd respondent herein who was the owner of the vehicle as \non the date of accident, did not contest the MCOP and remained ex-\nparte.  The  appellant  herein/Insurance  company,  resisted  the  claim \npetition on the ground that, it had not issued any insurance certificate \nto the vehicle in question as on the date of accident and that only a \nfew days after the accident, the proposal for insurance was made and \npremium for the same was paid based on which the cover note came \n4\nto be issued followed by the issuance of the insurance certificate. The \nfirst respondent herein chose to produce a xerox copy purporting to be \na copy of the cover note issued by the agent of the appellant for the \nvehicle involved in the accident. The same has been marked as Ex.P5. \nThough a rubber stamp has been affixed for certifying it to be a true \ncopy designating the person to certify it as true copy to be the counsel \nfor the petitioner, it has not been so certified. There is no proof to \nshow where from the first respondent/claimant had got that document. \nThe said document does not even contain an authentication made by \nthe Investigating Officer, to be a true copy. \n6. In the said circumstances, as rightly pointed out by the \nlearned counsel for the appellant, the same should have been either \ncreated by manipulation by the first  respondent/claimant himself  or \nshould have been created by manipulation by the 2nd respondent and \nhanded  over  to  the  first  respondent/claimant.  In  support  of  his \ncontention, the learned counsel for the appellant drew the attention of \nthe  court  to  Ex.R2-Proposal  from,  Ex.R3-Pre-Acceptance  Vehicle \nInspection Report, Ex.R4-declaration on the third party cheque signed \nby the 2nd respondent, Ex.R5-the premium receipt showing that the \npayment was made by way of a cheque dated 14.04.2008 and Ex.R6-\nCarbon copy of the cover note bearing cover Note No.7186113 issued \n5\non 14.04.2008 at 4.00 p.m and the policy issued on 26.04.2008 to be \neffective from 14.04.2008 produced as Ex.R7. A comparison of Ex.R6-\ncarbon  copy  of  the  cover  note  and  Ex.P5  will  show  that  the  date \ncolumns  alone  have  been  corrected  and  a  xerox  copy  has  been \nobtained. The particulars found in Ex.R6-carbon copy of the cover note \nare corroborated and strengthened by reliable documentary evidence, \nThat have been produced as Exs.R2 to R5 and R7. A perusal of all \nthose documents will show that proposal for insurance was made only \non 14.04.2008,  premium for  the same was paid by way of  cheque \ndated  14.04.2008  and  the  cover  note  was  also  prepared  on \n14.04.2008 to be effective from 14.04.2008. The accident took place 8 \ndays earlier, namely on 06.04.2008. \n7. It is not the case of the first respondent that the vehicle \nhad been insured with the appellant for the previous period also and \nwhat was sought to be done by the proposal was to renew the earlier \npolicy. It is also an admitted fact that for the first time, the appellant \nwas approached for the issuance of the policy. Therefore, this court \ndoes have no hesitation in coming to the conclusion that the appellant \nhas clearly proved that the vehicle was not covered by a policy issued \nby the appellant as on the date of accident and that the Tribunal has \ncommitted a grave error in holding that the vehicle stood insured with \n6\nthe appellant and hence the appellant was jointly and severally liable \nto pay compensation to the first respondent. In view of the above said \nconclusion, this court comes to the conclusion that the appeal is bound \nto be allowed and the award of the Tribunal has got to be modified by \nexonerating the appellant from the liability to pay compensation. \n8. Accordingly, the civil miscellaneous appeal is allowed. The \naward  of  the  Motor  Accidents  Claims  Tribunal  (FTC  No.4),  Ponneri \ndated 29.12.2010 made in  M.C.O.P.No.300 of  2008,  is  modified by \nholding that the amount awarded as compensation shall be payable \nonly by the 2nd respondent herein (first respondent in the MCOP) and \nthe  MCOP  as  against  the  appellant  herein  (2nd respondent  in  the \nMCOP), shall stand dismissed. However, there shall be no order as to \ncost. Consequently, the connected miscellaneous petition is closed.\n04.09.2013\nIndex :yes/no\nInternet :yes/no\nasr\nTo\nThe Motor Accidents Claims Tribunal, \nAdditional District Court, Fast Track Court No.4, Ponneri.\nP.R.SHIVAKUMAR, J.,\n7\n  asr\n         C.M.A. No.661 of 2011\n04.09.2013\n",

The brief facts are that on 8.7.2006 at about 9.30 a.m., \nwhile the deceased Praveen was riding a motor cycle at G.N.T. Road \nnear Karanodai Bridge along with the injured claimant Jaiganesh as a \n3\npillion rider, a lorry proceeding from the opposite direction, came in a \nrash and negligent manner at a hectic speed and dashed against the \ntwo wheeler, in which the rider and pillion rider of the two wheeler had \nsustained grievous injuries.  On the way to hospital, the rider of the \ntwo  wheeler  namely,  Praveen  died.   The  injured  victim  namely \nJaiganesh  had  sustained  multiple  injuries  all  over  the  body.   The \ninjured victim was admitted in the Stanley hospital.   Thereafter,  he \nwent to Sundaram Foundation hospital and took treatment as inpatient \nfor two days.   Alleging that the accident was due to the rash and \nnegligent  driving  of  the  driver  of  the  lorry,  the  legal  heirs  of  the \ndeceased  Praveen  have  filed  M.C.O.P.No.329  of  2006  claiming \ncompensation of a sum of Rs.60,00,000/- and the injured victim has \nfiled  the  claim  petition  in  M.C.O.P.No.330  of  2006  claiming \ncompensation of a sum of Rs.2,00,000/-.\n3.  Resisting  the  claim petitions,  the  insurance  company \nfiled counter affidavits denying the age, occupation and income of the \ndeceased  Praveen  and  the  injuries  sustained  by  the  claimant \nJaiganesh.  It  was  also  stated  that  the  driver  of  the  lorry  was  not \nresponsible for the accident and therefore, the insurance company is \nnot liable to pay the compensation.\n4\n4.  To  substantiate  the  claim,  the  injured  claimant \nexamined himself as P.W.1. The Mother of the deceased Praveen was \nexamined as P.W.2,  Dr.Thiyagarajan  was examined as P.W.3 and one \nSelvaragavan Mani was examined as P.W.4 in both the claim petitions. \nOn the side of the claimants, Exs.P1 to P17 were marked in both the \nclaim  petitions.  On  the  side  of  the  insurance  company,  one \nNeelamegam  was  examined  as  R.W.1,  one  Soundarapandian  was \nexamined as R.W.2 and one Easunathan was examined as R.W.3  and \nExs.R1 to R3 were marked in both the claim petitions.\n5. The Tribunal after going through the evidence, both oral \nand  documentary,  came  to  the  conclusion  that  the  accident  is  the \nresult  of  rash  and  negligent  driving  of  the  driver  of  the  lorry.  By \ncoming  to  such  a  conclusion,  the  Tribunal  has  awarded  a  sum  of \nRs.28,52,500/-  as against  the claim of  Rs.60,00,000/-  to the claim \nmade by the legal heirs of the deceased Praveen and awarded a sum \nof Rs.50,000/- as against the claim of Rs.2,00,000/- in respect of the \nclaim made by the injured claimant Jaiganesh.  Aggrieved over the \nsame, the insurance company has filed these two appeals.\n5\n6.  At  the  outset,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the \nappellant  /  insurance  company  submitted  that  the  accident  had \noccurred  only  due  to  the  negligent  act  of  the  deceased  Praveen \nhimself.   He has further  submitted that on the date of occurrence, \nthere is no valid fitness certificate for the lorry, which had caused the \naccident and hence, the Tribunal ought to have dismissed both the \nclaim petitions in toto.  In any event, the Tribunal ought to have come \nto the conclusion that there was a contributory negligence and thereby \nought to have deducted 50% of the amount from the compensation \nfixed in respect of the claim made by the legal heirs of the deceased \nPraveen.  The learned counsel appearing for the appellant / insurance \ncompany has also drawn the attention of this Court to Section 56 of \nthe Motor  Vehicles  Act  and submitted that  the vehicle  shall  not  be \ndeemed to  be  validly  registered,  unless  it  carries  the  certificate  of \nfitness.  In the instant case, the evidence on record would show that \nthe fitness certificate had expired as early as on 6.6.2006 itself and on \nthe  date  of  occurrence  i.e.,  on  8.7.2006,  it  was  not  in  force. \nTherefore, there is a statutory violation on the part of the owner of the \nlorry.  Under such circumstances, the insurance company is not liable \nto pay the compensation and only the owner of the lorry is liable to \n6\npay the compensation.  Hence, the award passed by the Tribunal as \nagainst the insurance company is liable to be set aside.\n7. We have heard the learned counsel on either side and \nperused the materials available on record.\n8. We find that though there was no valid fitness certificate \nfor  the lorry on the date of  accident,  on a perusal of the evidence \navailable  on  record,  it  is  clear  that  the  Inspector  of  the  insurance \ncompany,  who  was  examined  as  R.W.2,  has  admitted  in  his  cross \nexamination  that  the  Motor  Vehicle  Inspector  has  given  a  report \nstating that absolutely  there is no mechanical defect in the vehicle. \nThus, the evidence of  R.W.2 would show that even on the date of \noccurrence, the vehicle was found to be fit to run.  Moreover, we are of \nthe opinion that the evidence on record would show that the fitness \ncertificate had expired just one month prior to the date of occurrence \nand the same could be renewed at any time.  In this situation, we are \nof the opinion that since the vehicle was covered by insurance on the \ndate of accident, the insurance company cannot deny the payment of \ncompensation in respect of the claim made by the third parties.  So far \nas the third party claims are concerned, the insurance company can \n7\npay the compensation amount and recover the same from the owner \nof the vehicle.  In view of the above discussions, we are of the view \nthat since on the of accident there is no  valid fitness certificate, \nthe  insurance  company can pay the compensation and recover  the \nsame from the owner of the vehicle.\n9.  So far as the rash and negligent aspect is concerned, \nwe find that the insurance company has not chosen to examine the \ndriver of the lorry, who is the competent person to speak about the \nrash  and  negligent  act.   On  the  other  hand,  on  the  side  of  the \nclaimants, the injured victim Jaiganesh was examined as P.W.1, who \nhas spoken about the manner of the accident.  Hence, by considering \nthe evidence, both oral and documentary and connected materials, the \nTribunal has come to the conclusion that the accident had occurred \nonly due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the lorry. We \ndo not find any infirmity in the said finding.\n10. With regard to the quantum of compensation awarded \nin  respect  of  the  claim  made  by  the  legal  heirs  of  the  deceased \nPraveen  is  concerned,  we  find  that  the  deceased  was  working  as \n8\nSoftware Engineer in  H.C.L. Technologies India Limited and earning a \nsum of Rs.52,000/- per month.  In order to prove the income of the \ndeceased Praveen, on the side of the claimants, the Senior Manager of \nH.C.L.  Technologies India Limited was examined as P.W.4.  He has \nclearly  stated  in  his  evidence  that  the  said  Praveen  worked  as \nConsultant in the said company and was earning a sum of Rs.44,815/- \nper  month  and  his  annual  income  was  Rs.5,37,780/-.   The  salary \ncertificate of the deceased Praveen was also produced and marked as \nEx.P.7.   The  Tribunal,  by  relying  upon  the  evidence  of  P.W.4  and \nEx.P.7, has come to the conclusion that the take home salary of the \ndeceased Praveen is Rs.21,148/- which is rounded of Rs.21,000/- and \narrived  at  the   annual  income  of  the  deceased  Praveen  as \nRs.2,52,000/-.",

Respondent\n                                  \nCivil Miscellaneous Appeal filed under Order 43 Rule 1(t) of \nCPC against the fair and decreetal orders dated 01.04.2010 passed in \nI.A.No.1250 of 2009 in O.S.No.207 of 2008 on the file of the Addl. \nDistrict Court (Fast Track Court No.1), Salem.\nFor Appellants : Mr.P.Mani\nFor Respondent : Mr.S.Kaithamalai Kumaran\n2\n J U D G M E N T\nNotice before admission was given to the respondent and the \nrespondent has entered appearance through counsel. The arguments \nadvanced  by  Mr.P.Mani,  learned  counsel  for  the  appellants  and  by \nMr.S.Kaithamalai  Kumaran,  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent  are \nheard.\n            2.  The  appellants  1  and  2  are  husband  and  wife.  The \nrespondent Valli  is  none other  than the sister  of  the first  appellant \nRajamanickam.  The  suit  properties  are  admittedly  the  ancestral \nproperties  in  the  hands  of  Kaveri  Gounder,  the  father  of  the  first \nappellant and the respondent herein.  The said Kaveri  Gounder died \nintestate on 24.10.1998 leaving behind him the first appellant and the \nrespondent and also his wife Pavaiammal, as his legal representatives. \nThe said Pavaiammal also died on 21.02.2004. \n3. Claiming that the respondent along with the first appellant \nand  their  father  Kaveri  Gounder  constituted  a  Mitakshara  Hindu \nUndivided Family and on the death of Kaveri Gounder, the respondent \nand the first appellant became the surviving coparceners; that on the \ndeath of the third legal heir of Kaveri Gounder, namely Pavaiammal, \nthe share that would have gone to her from out of the share of the \nKaveri Gounder, also remained intact as the coparcenary property and \n3\nthat  the  first  appellant  and  the  respondent  were  entitled  to  equal \nshares  in  the  suit  properties,  the  respondent  had  filed  the  suit  in \nO.S.No.207/2008  on  the  file  of  the  District  Court,  Salem.  Since  a \nportion of the suit properties had been settled on the second appellant \nby the first appellant, she was also made a party defendant. The case \ncame to be assigned to the Additional District Judge (Fast Track Court \nNo.1), Salem for trial. \n4. The appellants (defendants 1 and 2) entered appearance \nto contest the case based on the written statement filed by the first \nappellant, which was adopted by the second appellant. After framing of \nissues, the case came to be listed for trial on various dates and at last, \nit  stood  listed  for  trial  on  01.07.2009.  The  case  was  opened  and \nevidence was led on the side of the respondent herein/plaintiff in part. \nSince  the  counsel  for  the  appellants/defendants  1  and  2  was  not \nprepared to cross-examine PW.1 on that date, the case was adjourned \nto 02.07.2009 for cross-examination of PW.1 and for examination of \nfurther  witnesses on the  side of  the respondent herein/plaintiff.  On \n02.07.2009, instead of cross-examining PW.1, the learned counsel for \nthe  appellants  herein/defendants  1  and  2,  reported  no  instruction, \npursuant  to  which  the  appellants  herein/defendants  1  and  2  were \ncalled absent and set ex-parte and the trial court proceeded with the \n4\ntrial, after setting the appellants herein/defendants 1 and 2 ex-parte. \nIt  pronounced  an  ex-parte  judgment  upholding  the  claim  of  the \nrespondent  herein/plaintiff  and granted  a  preliminary  decree  in  her \nfavour directing division of the suit properties into two equal shares \nand allotment of one such share to the respondent herein/plaintiff. \n5.  The  appellants,  who  suffered  the  ex-parte  preliminary \ndecree, chose to wait till the end of the time prescribed by the Statute \nand at the fag end of the time prescribed for filing an application to set \naside the ex-parte decree, filed an application under Order IX Rule 13 \nCPC  in  I.A.No.1250/2009  in  O.S.No.207/2008  on  the  file  of  the \nAdditional  District  Judge  (Fast  Track  Court  No.1),  Salem.  In  the \naffidavit filed in support of the application filed under Order IX Rule 13 \nCPC,  the  appellants  had  contended  that  the  case  was  looked  after \nsolely  by  the  first  appellant  and  he  fell  ill  due  to  jaundice;  that \npursuant to the advice tendered by a country doctor, who treated him \nwith herbal medicine, to take complete rest, he was not able to come \nto Salem to conduct the case and that only after his recovery from the \nillness, he came to know through his advocate on record in the lower \ncourt that such an ex-parte preliminary decree had been passed. \n6.  The said reason assigned by the appellants  was stoutly \n5\nrefuted  by  the  respondent  in  the  counter  filed  by  her.  It  was  her \ncontention that the appellants,  who deliberately left  the case to be \ndecided ex-parte, came forward with the said application with a view to \ndrag on the proceedings after a final decree application was filed by \nher.  The  learned  trial  judge  who  heard  the  application,  found that \nthough  the  application  was  filed  in  time,  the  appellants \nherein/defendants 1 and 2 were not able to prove to the satisfaction of \nthe  court  that  they  were  prevented  by  a  reasonable  cause  from \nappearing on the date on which the original suit stood posted for trial. \nThe learned trial judge also held that the appellants herein deliberately \nleft the suit to be decreed ex-parte, which was obvious from the fact \nthat the counsel, who was present on the date of opening of the case \nfor trial, chose to report 'no instruction'  the next day when he was \ncalled  upon  to  cross-examine  PW.1,  who  was  examined  on  the \nprevious day. \n7. It is also an admitted fact that a final decree application \nwas filed before the filing of the application under Order IX Rule 13 \nCPC. The same would show that there was no malafide on the part of \nthe respondent herein/plaintiff and she did not act with an intention of \nkeeping the appellants  in  dark  till  the time for  filing an application \nunder  Order  IX  Rule  13  CPC  would  expire.  It  is  not  an  accidental \n6\ncoincidence that the appellants chose to file the application to set aside \nthe ex-parte preliminary decree on the last day of limitation. The ex-\nparte  decree  was  passed  on  02.07.2009.  In  the  normal  course, \nlimitation would have expired on 01.08.2009. Since 01.08.2009 and \n02.08.2009 happened to be holidays, the appellants chose to file the \napplication on 03.08.2009. The same will show that the appellants had \nnot only allowed the suit to be decreed ex-parte, but also waited till \nthe last day to file the application to set aside the ex-parte preliminary \ndecree. \n8. It is also pertinent to note that the respondent had taken a \nplea in the plaint that her marriage was solemnized on 07.03.1990. \nThough the appellants would have chosen to contend in their written \nstatement  that  the  marriage  of  the  respondent  was  conducted  on \n10.03.1989 so as to disable her from claiming to be a coparcener by \nvirtue of Hindu Succession (Tamil Nadu Amendment) Act, 1989, they \nhad chosen to leave the suit to be proceeded ex-parte, in which, the \nrespondent  has  produced  her  marriage  invitation  in  proof  of  her \ncontention that her marriage took place on 07.03.1990, subsequent to \nthe amendment introduced to the Hindu Succession Act by the Tamil \nNadu Act 1 of 1990. \n9. It should also be noticed that the first appellant has chosen \n7\nto settle a part of the property in favour of his wife, namely the second \nappellant  in  2003  during  the  life  time  of  his  mother  Pavaiammal \ndisregarding  the  interest  of  the  said  Pavaiammal  and  also  the \nrespondent herein. Even assuming that she was not a coparcenar, she \nwas entitled to a share in the share of her husband. The fact that the \nfirst appellant chose to execute a gift settlement deed in favour of his \nwife (2nd appellant) disregarding the share of  Pavaiammal will  show \nlack of bonafide on the part of the appellants. The apprehension that \nthe appellants could not succeed in their defence could have been the \nonly reason for their keeping away from the court when the suit stood \nposted  fro  trial  leading  to  the  passing  of  the  ex-parte  preliminary \ndecree,  with  an  intention  to  protract  the  proceedings  as  long  as \npossible by filing an application to set aside the ex-parte decree. By \nadopting  such  a  method,  the  appellants  are  trying  to  drive  the \nrespondent to come to terms with them. The learned trial Judge has \napproached the problem in proper perspective and rightly decided that \nthe appellants herein were not proved to be prevented by a reasonable \ncause from appearing on the dates on which the case stood before the \ntrial court for trial and that the ex-parte preliminary decree could not \nbe set aside. This court does not find any defect or infirmity in the \norder  passed  by  the  trial  court  dismissing  I.A.No.1250/2009  in \nO.S.No.207/2008 filed under Order IX Rule 13 CPC to set aside the ex-\n8\nparte preliminary decree dated 02.07.2009. There is no merit in the \nappeal and the same deserves to be dismissed. \nAccordingly,  the  civil  miscellaneous  appeal  is  dismissed. \nHowever,  there  shall  be  no  order  as  to  costs.  Consequently,  the \nconnected miscellaneous petition is closed.\n03.09.2013\nIndex :yes/no\nInternet :yes/no\nasr\nTo\nThe Addl.

J.Ravindran\n2\nORDER\nThe  Revision   petitioner  is  the  tenant.  They  are  aggrieved \nagainst the order  of eviction concurrently passed by both the courts \nbelow under Section 14(1)(b) of the Tamil Nadu Buildings (Lease and \nRent  Control) Act, 1960.\n2.  The respondent herein as landlord filed RCOP No. 2156 of \n2007  on  the  file  of  the  Small  Causes  Court,  Chennai  seeking  for \neviction  of  the  petitioner  on  the  ground  of  demolition  and \nreconstruction.  According  to the landlord, the petition premises  is  in \na dilapidated condition and it may collapse at any  time and therefore \nthe building  requires  immediate demolition and reconstruction.  It is \nalso stated by them that they have got sufficient means to construct \nthe building.    Apart  from that,   it  is  contended by them that  the \nproposed  reconstruction  would  be  beneficial  and  advantageous   to \ntheir business.  The Corporation of Chennai also permitted the landlord \nto  demolish and reconstruct the building and sanctioned the building \nplan.\n 3.  The said application was resisted by the  tenant viz., the \npetitioner  herein.  The  learned  Rent  Controller  allowed  the  eviction \n3\npetition  by his order dated  18.10.2011.  Aggrieved against the same, \nthe tenant preferred an appeal in R.C.A.No. 630 of 2011 on the file of \nthe    Rent  Control   Appellate  Authority,  Chennai.    The  Appellate \nAuthority,  by an order dated 15.2.2013, dismissed the appeal and \nthereby confirmed the order  of  eviction.   Hence,  the present Civil \nRevision Petition is filed before this Court.\n 4.  Heard the learned counsel for either side and perused the \nmaterials placed  before this Court.\n5.    The learned counsel  appearing  for  the  petitioner  would \nsubmit as follows:-\n There is no bonafide requirement on the  part of the landlord. \nThe  learned  appellate  authority   failed  to  consider  the  additional \nevidence let in under Ex.R7 showing that the landlord did not obtain \nplanning  permission  and   only  a  third  party   obtained  planning \npermission in respect of petition premises.    Thus, according to the \nlearned counsel, the requirement is not for the benefit of the   landlord \nand for a third party.  The permission granted  by the Corporation of \nChennai for  demolition and reconstruction  got expired even before \nfiling the RCOP and no renewal was obtained by the  landlord.   It is \nfurther contended by him that the  appellate authority has passed a \ncryptic order  without discussing the facts and circumstances  in detail \n4\nin respect of  Ex.R7.  The appellate authority should give reasons for \narriving the conclusions and    in support of such submission, learned \ncounsel  relied on the decisions reported  in    1992 (1) L.W. 315 \n(C.Shanmugham  Vs.

Prabhakar \nBalkrishna  Mahanubhav);  and   2004  (4)  L.W.  768 \n(  K.Periyanayagam Vs.  J.K.Savithri  and  Others).  Thus,   the \nlearned counsel submitted that the matter may be remitted  back to \nthe appellate authority for considering  Ex.R7.\n 6. Per contra,   learned counsel appearing  for the respondent \nlandlord would submit as follows:-\n Ex.R7 relates to the building and  premises at Door No. 693, \nwhereas   the  petition  premises  is  at   Door  No.  695,  Anna  Salai, \nChennai 6.  Therefore, the  tenant is not justified in relying on  Ex.R7 \nto contend  as if the eviction is  sought for   to benefit a third party. \nNotice issued by the Corporation dated  12.9.2011 was accepted by \nthe tenant in his written argument filed in RCOP. Therefore, they  have \nthe full knowledge about the said notice.  Chennai Metro Rail Limited \nalso referred the building as the one  under severe damage category, \n5\nwhile  conducting  Pre-Construction  Building  Condition  survey   for \nconstruction of  underground station  at Government Estate etc. The \nlearned  counsel,  in  support  of  her   submissions,  relied  on   the \ndecisions  reported  in  2002(4)   SCC  437  (  R.V.E.Venkatachala \nGounder Vs. Venkatesha Gupta and Others), 2006 (4) SCC 507 \n(S.Venugopal Vs. A.Karruppusami and Another)  and 2013 (2) \nMWN  (Civil) 577  ( K.Sekar and Another Vs. R.Palanivelu).\n7.  The point that arises  for consideration in this Civil Revision \nPetition is  as to whether the order of  eviction passed by the Courts \nbelow, concurrently  against the petitioner,   is liable to be interfered \nwith ?\n8.   Both sides admit that the present Door Number  of  the \npetition premises is   New No. 268 (Old No.695), Anna Salai, Chennai \n600006.   The respondent / landlord seeks eviction of the petitioner \non the ground  of demolition and reconstruction.   It is their contention \nthat the building is in  a dilapidated condition and it may collapse at \nany  time. Apart from contending so, they also stated that  as their \nbusiness is increasing manifold,   it will be beneficial and advantageous \nfor them to demolish and construct a new building. Thus,  it is clear \n6\nthat  on two reasons they  seek demolition and reconstruction viz., the \nbuilding is in a dilapidated condition and  they want to  augment the \nincome .\n9.  In so  far as the condition of the building is concerned, the \nlandlord  have  already  approached  the  Corporation  and  obtained \nplanning permit which proceedings  are marked as Exs.P4 to P7. Thus , \ntheir intention to demolish and reconstruct  is evident.    No  doubt, \nthe tenant contends that the time granted by the  Corporation had \nalready expired even before filing the RCOP.  That itself  cannot be \nconstrued  as  a reason  to hold that the claim is without bona fide, \nespecially  under the circumstances  that the  building  which is sought \nto be demolished is still under the possession of the petitioner/ tenant. \nNeedless to say  that only when the petitioner is evicted, the question \nof demolishing the building would arise.   Therefore, the expiry of the \ntime granted by Corporation cannot be put against the landlord.  \n10.  More over,  both sides admit that the Chennai Metro Rail \nLimited  conducted a Pre-Construction Building Condition survey  for \nconstruction of underground stations. Based on the survey  a general \ninformation is furnished by the Chennai Metro Rail  Limited, wherein \n7\nthe present  petition building is shown as the one  lying under  severe \ndamage category.   The said information details  are placed before this \nCourt  and the same are  not  disputed by the petitioner.   It  is  also \nstated therein that the petition premises is located at a  distance of \n12.75 metre from the tunnel center line and that risk category of this \nbuilding is severe.   Apart from the said fact, Chennai  Corporation also \nissued a notice on  12.9.2011 to the landlord under Section 258 of the \nChennai City Municipal  Act 1919 informing that the petition building is \nin a  ruinous state or dangerous to  passers by or to the occupiers of \nneighbouring structures and thus the Corporation has called upon the \nlandlord to  prevent   any danger   therefrom.  A copy of the said \nnotice is also placed before this Court. The issuance of the said notice \nwould also show that the building is in a dilapidated condition.  Apart \nfrom the said fact, the landlord  seeks  demolition and reconstruction \nof a new building  also on the reason  of  to augment  their income by \ncontending that their business is increasing manifold and therefore it \nwould  be   beneficial  and  advantageous   for  them to  demolish  and \nreconstruct a new building.",

They  filed \nR.C.O.P.No.1533  of  2001  on  the  file  of  the Small  Causes  Court, \nChennai  against  the  respondents  herein  seeking  eviction  under \nsections  10(2)(ii)(a)  and  10(3)(a)(iii)  of  the  Tamilnadu  Buildings \n(Lease  and  Rent  Control)  Act  18  of  1960.   The  learned  Rent \nController dismissed the eviction petition.  The landlords preferred \nan  appeal  before  the  Rent  Control  Appellate  Authority  in \nR.C.A.No.703/2003.  The Appellate Authority by concurring with the \nfindings  rendered  by  the  learned  Rent  Controller  dismissed  the \nappeal.   Thus,  the  present  civil  revision  petition  is  filed  by  the \nlandlords.\n2.The case of the landlords/petitioners is as follows:\nThey are the co-owners of the petition premises at No.50 \n(old)  and  103  (New),  Armenian  Street,  G.T.,  Chennai  600  001. \n3\nThey  entered  into  a  lease  agreement  dated  30.01.1992  with  one \nP.Tamilarasi  in  respect  of  a  non-residential  portion  of  the  above  said \npremises marked as shop No.9 in the ground floor.  The monthly rent \npayable  is  Rs.2,700/-  per  month.   The  12th petitioner  is  carrying  on \nbusiness  along  with  his  father  under  the  name  and  style  of  Shazaib \nTrading Company at No.99 (Old), 203 (New), Angappa Naicken Street, \nChennai 600 001, which is a rented premises.  The 12th petitioner being \nthe co-owner of the petition premises seeks the same on the ground of \nowners  occupation  so  as  to  enable  him to  shift  his  business  from the \nrented premises.  Further, when the lease agreement was entered only \nwith  the  said  Tamilarasi,  he  had  sublet  the  petition  premises  to  a \nCompany called a  National  Hardware  India without  the consent  of  the \nlandlords.   The  second  respondent  is  the  Proprietor  of  the  said  Firm. \nTherefore, on both the ground of owners occupation and subletting, the \nlandlords filed the above civil revision petition.\n3.The respondents herein as the respondents before the Rent \nController denied the contentions raised by the petitioners.  They disputed \nthe bonafide requirement of the 12th petitioner.  It  is also disputed by \nthem  that  there  is  no  subletting  and  on  the  other  hand,  the  second \nrespondent  is  the  husband  of  the  said  Tamilarasi  who  in  turn,  is  the \nManaging Director of the first respondent Company.\n4.The  learned  Rent  Controller  as  well  as  the  First  Appellate \nAuthority rejected the claim of the landlords by holding that there is no \n4\nsub tenancy and that the claim of the 12th petitioner on the ground of \nowners occupation is without bonafide.\n5.In  this  civil  revision  petition,  notice  was  ordered  to  the \nrespondents. However, the Court Amin could not effect service of notice \non the reason that the premises was found locked always.  It was also \nnoted by the Amin that there was no name board in the said address. \nPrivate notice sent was also returned as 'no such person'.  Therefore, this \nCourt directed substituted service.  Consequently, the substituted service \nwas also effected by paper publication on 18.07.2013.  When the matter \nwas  taken  up  for  hearing  on  19.08.2013,  none  appeared  for  the \nrespondents and however, their names were printed in the causelist.\n6.Heard Mr.V.Prakash, learned senior counsel appearing for the \npetitioners and perused the materials placed before this Court.\n7.The petitioners are the landlords.  They seek eviction of the \nrespondents  on  two  grounds  viz.,  owners  occupation  under  section \n10(3)(a)(iii) and subletting under section 10(2)((ii)(a) of the Tamilnadu \nBuildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act.  \n8. In so far as the ground of subletting is concerned, it is the \ncontention  of  the  landlords  that  the  premises  was  sublet  by  the  first \nrespondent/tenant  to  the  second  respondent.  It  is their contention \nthat  the  second   respondent  is   carrying  on   business  in   the \npetition  premises   under   the   name   and  style  of  National  Hardware \n5\nIndia.  A perusal  of the averments made in the eviction petition \nwould show that except saying that the first respondent has sublet \nthe premises to the second respondent without written consent of \nthe petitioners,  no other  details  were given by the petitioners  in \nrespect  of  the  relationship  between  the  first  and  second \nrespondents.  On the other hand, it is contended by the respondents \nthat  the  first  respondent  is  continuously  doing  business  in  the \npetition premises and the second respondent is none other than the \nhusband  of  the  Managing  Director  of  the  first  respondent  and \ntherefore, there is no subletting of the premises in favour of the \nsecond  respondent.  The  said  contention  with  regard  to  the \nrelationship between the parties is not disputed by the landlords.  At \nthe time of arguing the matter before the court below, the landlords \nsubmitted that the lease deed was executed in favour of Tamilarasi, \nwho  sublet  the  premises  to  the  first  respondent  and  the  first \nrespondent's  son  is  doing  business  in  the  the  petition  premises. \nEven though such argument was advanced before the Court, there \nwas no pleadings to that effect.  The Appellate Authority has rightly \nfound that in the absence of any pleadings, no amount of evidence \ncan be looked into.  \n9.It  is  an  admitted  fact  that  the  said  Tamilarasi  is  the \nManaging  Director  of  the  first  respondent  Company.   It  is  also \nadmitted that the second respondent viz., Subbiah is the husband of \n6\nthe said Tamilarasi.  Even though it is contended by the landlords \nthat they let the premises only in favour of Tamilarasi, they have \nfiled  the  eviction  petition  by  arraying  the  Company  as  the  first \nrespondent, in which, the said Tamilarasi is acting as a Managing \nDirector.  It is specifically admitted by them in their eviction petition \nthat the respondent is their tenant.  That means they recognised \nthe Hydraulics and Prime Movers Agencies, Pvt. Limited represented \nby its Managing Director Mrs.P.Tamilarasi as the tenant.  Therefore, \nthey cannot be permitted to contend that the premises was let out \nonly to Tamilarasi in her individual capacity, who in turn, sublet the \npremises to the second respondent.  \n10.No doubt, the landlords marked Exs.P11, P12, P15, P16 \nto  P18  viz.,  telephone  bills  and  postal  covers  to  show  that  the \nsecond respondent is doing the business in the petition premises. \nHowever, it is not specifically pleaded or proved before the courts \nbelow that the second respondent alone is in exclusive possession of \nthe petition premises and that the first respondent is not doing the \nbusiness therein.  Therefore, the courts below has rightly rejected \nthe petition on the ground of subletting with which this Court finds \nno ground to interfere.\n11.In  so  far  as  the  other  ground  viz.",

Respondent\nPrayer: Petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to \ncall for the records of SC No.66 of 2012 on the file of the second Additional \nDistrict and Sessions Judge, Ranipet, Vellore District, set aside the order in \nCr.M.P.No.415 of 2012 dated 03.12.2012.  \nFor Petitioner      :  Mr.Karthic for\n                                                         T.S.Gopalan and Co.  \nFor Respondents :  No appearance \n  ORDER\nRajkumar, the sole accused, aggrieved by the dismissal of his \npetition under Section 91 Cr.P.C.  in Crl.M.P.No.415 of 2012 in the Sessions \nCase No.66 of 2012 pending before the learned Additional Sessions Judge \n(formerly  Fast  Track  Court),  Ranipet,  Vellore  District,  has  directed  this \npetition. \n2\n2.  An untoward incident has taken place on a day, on the railway \ntrack, near Chitheri Railway station, between Katpadi and Arokonam.  In \nthis, 11 persons have died and number of persons have sustained injuries. \nAt  that  time, petitioner had driven the ill-fated train.   A case in Crime \nNo.623 of  2011  has  been  registered  by  the  Railway  Police,  Arakonam. \nAfter investigation, final report has been filed before the Committal Court. \nThe  Magistrate  committed  the  case  to  the  Court  of  Principal  Sessions \nJudge, Vellore. It was made over to II Additional Sessions Judge, Ranipet.  \n3.  Prior to framing of charges, the petitioner filed the petition  in \nCrl.M.P.No.415  of  2012  under  Section  91  Cr.P.C.  seeking  production  of \ncertain  documents  furnishing  list  of  documents,  their  details,  their \nwhereabouts and their need for making his effective defence.  \n4.  Charges under Section 304-A, 279, 337, 338, 323, 324, 326, \n304, 308 IPC and Section 3 Tamil Nadu Property (Prevention of damage \nand Loss) Act,1992 r/w 152 Railways Act,1999 have been framed.\n5. On 3.12.2012,  the trial Court dismissed the petition under \nSection 91 Cr.P.C.  on  the  ground that  it  is  intended to  delay  the  trial, \nhowever, the trial Court given him liberty to renew his request at a later \nstage.  \n3\n6.  The learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the trial \nCourt has not viewed the plea of the petitioner in proper perspective. The \nlearned counsel further submitted that the case involves many technical \naspects relating to railway operations, those documents are necessary to \ncross examine the prosecution witnesses.\n     \n7.  The learned Additional Public Prosecutor submitted that the \nattempt of the accused to delay the trial has been thwarted by the trial \nCourt.   \n \n8.   Under  the  scheme  of  administration  of  criminal  justice \ndevised in the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973, an accused is entitled to \nkeep mum, refuse to plead. \n9.  It  is  basic  that  every  one   including  accused  persons  are \npresumed to be innocent. It is one's  basic human right.(See Article 21, \nConstitution of India).  Till the guilt alleged as against him is established \nbeyond all reasonable doubts, the accused is presumed  to be innocent. It \nis the basic duty of the prosecution to prove it. \n10.  It is the basic constitutional and human right of accused \npersons to defend themselves as against the allegations, charges levelled \n4\nagainst them. (See Article 21,22(1) and Section 303 Cr.P.C). They must be \ngiven reasonable opportunity to defend themselves. The defence may be \nbased  on  oral  statements  of  persons,  documents,  material  objects,  or \nscientific reports. The documents may be somewhere.  They may be in the \npossession of some individuals or institutions. Section 91 Cr.P.C. enables \ntheir production.  \n11.  Petition under Section 91 Cr.P.C. can be filed either by the \nprosecutor  or  by  the  defence,  at  any  stage  of  the  case,  but  before \njudgment.  \n12. Reasonable  opportunity must be given to the accused to \ndefend himself.  It is for the defence to device the defence. It is not for the \nprosecution nor for the Court to direct his manner of taking the defence,.\n13. When question of defending against the serious accusations \ncomes, question of delay etc., pale into insignificance. \n14. The defence has to be given sufficient opportunity well in \nadvance  to  prepare  well  before  the  prosecution  witness  are  produced. \nTherefore, the observation of the trial Court that the petitioner may  renew \nhis request at a later stage of the case is not correct. \n5\n 15.  Thus, the learned Additional Sessions Judge has not viewed \nthe matter in proper perspective.  The order passed by the  trial Court is \nvitiated.  \n16.  In the circumstances, the impugned order passed by the \nlearned Additional Sessions Judge, Ranipet,  in Crl.M.P.No.415 of 2012 in \nS.C.  No.66  of  2012  is  set  aside.   Crl.M.P.415  of  2012  is  allowed.  By \n13.9.2013,  the  respondent  shall  produce  the  documents  listed  in \nCrl.M.P.No.415 of 2012.  The trial Court will give sufficient opportunity to \nthe accused with reference to those documents. Accordingly, the criminal \noriginal petition is disposed of.  Consequently, connected M.P. is closed.    \n  \n               04.09.2013 \nIndex : Yes \nInternet : Yes \nrrg \nTo\n1.The Additional Sessions Judge,\n   Ranipet,\n   Vellore District.\n2.Deputy Superintendent of Police,\n   Govt.

Not  being  satisfied  with  the  quantum of \ncompensation awarded by the tribunal, the claimants have filed the \nappeal  in  C.M.A.No.1115  of  2012.    Hence,  both  the  appeal  are \ndisposed of by way of this common judgment.\n3\n2.For the sack of convenience, the parties will be referred as per \ntheir  ranking  in  C.M.A.No.2575  of  2009.     The  appellant  is  the \ninsurance company and the respondents  are the mother, father and \nsister of the deceased D.Ravi respectively.\n3.It is the case of the respondents/claimants that on 12.11.2012 \nat about 7.45 hours, while the deceased D.Ravi was proceeding in his \ntwo wheeler towards Ambattur Estate, the lorry bearing Registration \nNo.TN-02-B-0553 came in a rash and negligent manner and hit the \ntwo wheeler, as a result of which the deceased sustained multiple and \nfatal injuries and died on the spot.  Hence, the respondents/claimants \nmade a claim for a sum of Rs.45 lakhs as compensation as against the \nowner of the lorry and its Insurer/appellant herein.\n4.Before the Tribunal, in order to prove their claim, on the side \nof  the  respondents/claimants,  the  1st respondent/mother  of  the \ndeceased  examined  herself  as  P.W.1,  besides  examining  two  other \nwitnesses as P.W.2 & P.W.3, and Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.30 were marked.   On \nthe  side  of  the  Insurance  Company,  neither  oral  nor  documentary \nevidence  was  produced.    The  Tribunal,  after  analysing  the  entire \nevidence,  has  passed  an award for  a  total  sum of  Rs.24,59,112/-. \nHence, the present appeals.\n4\n5.Since  the  appeals  have  been  filed  only  questioning  the \nquantum of compensation, there is no need for this Court to go into \nother aspects.\n6.With regard to the quantum of compensation, it is the case of \nthe  respondents/claimants  before  the  Tribunal  that  at  the  time  of \naccident,  the deceased was 26 years  old and he was possessing a \nMaster  Degree  in  Computer  Science  and  he  was  an  income-tax \nassessee and he was employed at Wipro Company and earning a sum \nof Rs.2,82,935/- per annum.  In order to prove the income earned by \nthe deceased, on the side of the respondents/claimants, the Manager-\nHR  of  the  Wipro  Technologies  was  examined  as  P.W.3  and  Salary \nCertificate was marked as Ex.P.19 and Income-Tax SARAL Form was \nmarked as Ex.P.28.\n7.The Tribunal by placing reliance upon the evidence of P.W.3 \nand Ex.P.19 & Ex.P.28 has fixed a sum of Rs.2,82,935/- as annual \ngross income of the deceased and after deducting 1/3 amount towards \npersonal  expenses  of  the  deceased,  the  Tribunal  by  taking  into \nconsideration the  age of  the mother  of  the  deceased,  who was 45 \nyears at the time of the death of her son, by applying the multiplier of \n13, has awarded a sum of Rs.24,52,112/- for loss of income. \n5\n8.Now,  it  is  the  submission  of  the  learned  counsel  for  the \nappellant/Insurance  Company  that  a  perusal  of  the  SARAL  Form-\nEx.P.28, would reveal that the annual taxable income of the deceased \nis only Rs.2,06,620/- for the assessment year 2002-2003, whereas the \nTribunal  has  taken  into  consideration  the  Gross  income  of  the \ndeceased viz., Rs.2,82,935/- for calculating the loss of income to the \nclaimants on the account of the death of the deceased in the accident. \nThe  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant/Insurance  Company  further \nsubmitted that the deceased had worked in Wipro Company only for \ntwo  days  and when that  being so,  the  Tribunal  ought  not  to have \nplaced reliance on  Ex.P.28 and thereby, the Tribunal ought not to \nhave fixed the annual loss of income as Rs.2,82,935/-.  Hence, by \nfixing the total taxable income of the deceased as his actual annual \nincome, the compensation amount awarded by the Tribunal has to be \nreduced.\n9.Further,  the  learned  counsel  for  the  appellant/Insurance \nCompany submitted that the claim was made by the parents of the \ndeceased, who was a bachelor at the time of the accident.  Under such \ncircumstances,  the  Tribunal  ought  to  have deducted  50% from the \nincome towards his personal expenses,  whereas the Tribunal deducted \n6\nonly 1/3 amount, which ultimately resulted in awarding an exorbitant \namount as compensation. \n10.The learned counsel for the appellant/Insurance Company has \nalso submitted that the Tribunal has failed to deduct amount towards \nincome tax from the total compensation amount.  Hence, 20% amount \nfrom the total compensation is liable to be deducted towards income-\ntax deduction.\n11.It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the appellant \nthat the sister of the deceased cannot be construed as a dependent of \nher deceased brother and hence, the compensation amount awarded \nby the Tribunal by taking into account the sister of the deceased as \none of the dependents is not correct. \n12.Per contra, the learned counsel for the respondents/claimants \nby  placing  reliance  upon  the  recent  judgment  of  the  Honourable \nSupreme Court reported in 2012 ACJ 2002 [Amrit Bhanu Shali Vs. \nNational  Insurance  Co.  Ltd.] submitted  that  at  the  time  of \ncalculating the quantum of loss of income in the case of death of a \nbachelor, the Tribunal ought to have taken the age of the deceased \ninto  consideration  for  applying  the  multiplier  method.   Hence,  by \ntaking the age of the deceased, who was 26 years at the time of death \n7\ninto consideration, and by applying higher multiplier, the compensation \namount has to be enhanced.\n13.The  learned  counsel  for  the  respondents/claimants  further \nsubmitted  that  the  Tribunal  has  not  awarded  any  amount  towards \nfurther  prospects  and  therefore,  there  is  no  need  to  deduct  any \namount towards income-tax.\n14.That apart, the learned counsel for the respondents/claimants \nby  relying  upon  the  judgment  of  the  Honourable  Supreme  Court \nreported in  1987 ACJ 561 (SC) [Gujarat State Road Transport \nCorpn.,  Ahmedabad Vs. Ramanbhai Prabhatbhai and another] \nsubmitted  that  the  brother  &  sister  of  the  deceased  could  be \nconsidered as dependents for the purpose of awarding compensation. \n15.Keeping  the  submissions  made  on  either  side,  We  have \ncarefully gone through the entire materials available on record.\n16.On perusal of Ex.P.28 – Income Tax SARAl Form, We find that \nthe gross income of the deceased was Rs.2,82,935/- and the taxable \nincome of the deceased was Rs.2,06,620/- for the assessment year \n2002-2003.    The  Tribunal  has  taken  into  consideration  the  gross \nincome of the deceased for calculating the loss of income.   We do not \n8\nfind any infirmity in the award passed by the Tribunal in fixing the \nannual income of the deceased as Rs.2,82,935/-.  Therefore, We are \nnot inclined to accept the submission made by the learned counsel for \nthe appellant that by fixing the total taxable income of Rs.2,06,620/- \nas annual income of the deceased, the compensation amount has to be \nreduced. \n17.It is the submission of the learned counsel for the appellant \nthat the deceased had worked only for two days in Wipro Company \nand under such circumstances, the Tribunal ought not to have placed \nreliance upon the evidence of  P.W.3 and Salary Certificate Ex.P.19. \nBut, We find from the evidence on record that even prior to joining in \nthe Wipro Company, the deceased had been working in another private \ncompany, which is evident from Ex.Ps.20 to 25, and he was making a \ngood income and he was possessing a Master  Degree in Computer \nScience.   Irrespective  of  the  submissions  made  on  either  side, \nconsidering the qualification of the deceased as well  as the income \nwhich  the  deceased  was  making  till  his  death,  the  sum  of \nRs.2,82,935/- fixed by the Tribunal as his annual income can not be \nsaid to be exorbitant.\n9\n18.While  making  his  submissions  the  learned  counsel  for  the \nrespondents/claimants by placing reliance upon the judgment reported \nin 2012 ACJ 2002 [Amrit Bhanu Shali Vs. National Insurance Co. \nLtd.], submitted  that  as  per  the  said  judgment,  the  age  of  the \ndeceased could be taken into consideration in the case of death of the \nbachelor in the accident.",

JUSTICE R.SUBBIAH\nC.M.A.No.2618 of 2011 \nand M.P.No.1 of 2011\nThe Managing Director,\nTamil Nadu State Transport Corporation Ltd.,\nDivision I, Villupuram. ...  Appellant\n   vs.\nC.Shanthi ...  Respondent \nCivil  Miscellaneous  Appeal  has  been  filed  under  Section \n173 of Motor Vehicles Act against the award made in MCOP No.49 of \n2008  dated  23.12.2010  on  the  file  of  the  Motor  Vehicles  Accident \nClaims Tribunal, Prl. Sub Judge, Virudhachalam.\nFor appellant      : Mrs.B.Vijaya Lakshmi\nFor respondent : Mr.S.Udayakumar \nJUDGMENT\nR.SUBBIAH, J\nQuestioning the quantum of compensation awarded by the \nlearned  Principal   Sub.  Judge,   Motor   Accident   Claims   Tribunal, \n2\nVirudhachalam, by order dated 23.12.2010 made in M.C.O.P.No.49 of \n2008, the present appeal has been filed by the Transport Corporation.\n2.  The  claim  petition  was  filed  by  the  injured  victim \nC.Shanthi, represented by her husband Paramasivam, claiming a sum \nof Rs.70,00,000/- as compensation for the disability suffered by her in \nthe road accident that had occurred on 29.8.2007 involving the bus \nbelonging to the appellant Transport Corporation.\n3. It is the case of the respondent / claimant before the \nTribunal that on 29.8.2007 at about 9.30 a.m., while she was riding a \nmotor cycle from her residence to Pasikulam Village, the bus belonging \nto the appellant Transport Corporation came in a rash and negligent \nmanner and dashed against her, due to which she sustained severe \ninjuries all over the body.  On account of the disability  caused to her \npursuant to the accident,  she has become totally immobilised and for \nthe rest of her life, she cannot carry on her avocation, who was  a \nSecondary Grade  Teacher  by profession.   Hence,  she  has  filed  the \nclaim petition through her husband, claiming a sum of Rs.70,00,000/- \nas compensation.\n3\n4.  Resisting the claim petition, the Transport Corporation \nhas filed a counter affidavit denying the age, occupation and income of \nthe victim and also the injuries sustained by her. It was also stated \nthat the driver of the bus was not responsible for the accident and \ntherefore,  the  Transport  Corporation  is  not  liable  to  pay  the \ncompensation.\n5. In order to prove the claim, on the side of the claimant, \nher  husband  Paramasivam  examined  himself  as  P.W.1,  besides \nexamining  three  other  witnesses  as  P.Ws.2  to  4  and  marked  20 \ndocuments  as  Exs.P.1  to  P.20.   On  the  side  of  the  Transport \nCorporation,  the driver  of  the bus was examined as R.W.1,  but no \ndocument was produced.\n6. The Tribunal after analysing the entire evidence, both \noral and documentary, has come to the conclusion that the accident \nhad occurred  due to the rash and negligent driving of the driver of the \nTransport Corporation.  Coming to such a conclusion, the Tribunal has \nawarded  a  sum  of  Rs.44,24,554/-  as  against  the  claim  of \nRs.70,00,000/-.  Aggrieved over  the quantum of compensation, the \nTransport Corporation has filed the present appeal.\n4\n7. Since the present appeal has been filed only questioning \nthe quantum of compensation, there is no need for this Court to deal \nwith the other aspects of the award.\n8.  So far as the quantum of compensation is concerned, it \nis the submission of the learned counsel appearing for the appellant \nTransport Corporation that in order to prove the income earned by the \nvictim, her  salary certificate was marked as Ex.P.11.   A perusal  of \nEx.P.11 would show that the monthly income of the injured victim was \nRs.9,543/-.   But,  the  Tribunal  by  fixing  a  sum  of  Rs.18,262/-  as \nmonthly income, has made the calculation by applying the multiplier of \n16,  which resulted in awarding a sum of  Rs.35,06,304/-  under the \nhead of loss of income.\n9. With regard to the calculation made by the Tribunal, \nlearned  counsel  appearing  for  the  Transport  Corporation  submitted \nthat  when  the  salary  certificate   viz.,  Ex.P.11  shows  the  monthly \nincome of the victim as Rs.9,543/-, the Tribunal ought to have made \nthe calculation only based on the said amount, not fixing any higher \nsum as monthly income.\n5\n10. Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the claimant \nsubmitted that the Tribunal by taking note of the recommendation of \nthe VI Pay Commission as well as the future increment in salary, had \nfixed a sum of Rs.18,262/- as monthly income and as such, there is no \ninfirmity in the calculation made by the Tribunal by fixing a sum   of \nRs.18,262/-  as  monthly  income.   That  apart,  the  learned  counsel \nfurther  submitted  that  the  Tribunal  has  not  awarded any  adequate \ncompensation under the other heads and therefore, there is no need to \ninterfere with the award amount.\n11. Keeping the submission made by either side, we have \ncarefully gone through the materials available on record.\n12. Due to the accident, the injured victim / claimant had \nsustained severe injuries all over the body.  The evidence on record \nwould show that  now she has become immobilised and she is being \nfed  through  the  tube  and  she  is  excreting  urine  and  motion  only \nthrough the tube and she is in coma stage.  On the date of accident, \nshe was working as Secondary Grade Teacher and earning a sum of \nRs.9,543/- per month which is evident from Ex.P.11.  Considering the \nnature of injuries  and also the consequential disability suffered by her, \nwe are of the opinion that the injured victim has to survive the rest of \n6\nher life only in bed.  It is apparent that the injured victim cannot do \nany avocation for the rest of her life. Therefore, we do not find any \ninfirmity in the method of calculation made by the Tribunal to arrive at \nthe compensation under the head of loss of income. But, at the same \ntime, we find that while making calculation under the head of loss of \nincome,  the  Tribunal  has  fixed  a  sum  of  Rs.18,262/-  as  monthly \nincome based on the VI Pay Commission recommendations and also \ncalculating  the  future  increment  in  her  salary.  In  our  considered \nopinion, a sum of Rs.18,262/- fixed by the Tribunal as monthly income \nof the injured victim is not correct,  since no tangible evidence was \nproduced before the Court with regard to the future increment in her \nsalary.  Therefore,  we are of the opinion that the amount awarded \nunder the head of loss of income needs appropriate modification.\n13.  As per Ex.P.11, the monthly income of the deceased \nwas only Rs.9,543/-.  As per the dictum laid down in 2009 ACJ 1298 \nin  the  case  of  Sarla  Verma  and  others  vs.   Delhi  Transport \nCorporation and another, the injured victim is entitled to another \n50% of the amount towards future prospects.   50% on the monthly \nincome of Rs.9,543/- works out to Rs.4,777/-.  If Rs.4,777/- is added \nto the monthly income of Rs.9,543/-, the total amount works out to \nRs.14,320/-, which can be safely fixed as loss of monthly income.  The \n7\ninjured  victim  was  aged  about  35  years  at  the  time  of  accident. \nHence, the correct multiplier that has to be applied in this case is 15. \nIf  multiplier  15  is  applied,  the  total  amount  works  out  to \nRs.25,77,600/-  (Rs.14,320/-  X  12  X  15  =  Rs.25,77,600/-),  which \namount could be awarded as just and proper compensation under the \nhead of loss of earning.\n14.  In  view  of  the  discussions  made  above,  the  total \namount of compensation awarded by the Tribunal under the head of \nLoss  of  earnings  namely,  Rs.35,06,304/-  is  hereby  reduced  to \nRs.25,77,600/-.  Except this modification, the amount awarded by the \nTribunal under the other  heads remains unaltered.  Thus,  the total \ncompensation of Rs.44,24,554/- is hereby reduced to Rs.34,45,850/- \nas under:- \nHeading Amount awarded by \nthe Tribunal\nRs.\nAmount now awarded\nRs.\nLoss of earning 35,06,304/- 25,77,600/-\nPain and suffering 1,00,000/- 1,00,000/-\nMedical Expenses 5,68,250/- 5,68,250/-\nTransport expenses 25,000/- 25,000/-\nAttender Charges 2,00,000/- 2,00,000/-\nExtra nourishment 25,000/- 25,000/-\nTotal 44,24,554/- 34,45,850\n15.  With  the  above  modification,  the  appeal  is  partly \n8\nallowed.  No costs.\n16.  The  appellant  Transport  Corporation  is  directed  to \ndeposit  the  balance  amount  after  deducting  the  amount  that  has \nalready been deposited by them with proportionate interest at the rate \nof  7.5% per annum within a period of  six  weeks  from the date of \nreceipt of a copy of this judgment.  On such deposit, the injured victim \n/  claimant  is  permitted  to  withdraw  the  entire  amount  with \nproportionate interest.

He was upgraded as Grade I Police Constable on 7.8.1993.\n2. While so, he was placed under suspension on 17.9.1998  in \nconnection with registration of a criminal case in DCB Crime No.1 of \n1996 relating to illegal arrest and detention of one S.Balaraman.  The \nsuspension was  subsequently revoked on 6.2.2001.  He joined duty \non 19.2.2001.\n3. However, he was convicted by the learned Judicial Magistrate, \nVanur by judgment dated 21.8.2006 in C.C.No.52 of 1998.  Based on \nthe same, he was dismissed from service with effect from 6.10.2006 \nby proceedings of the second respondent  dated 29.9.2006.\n4.  The  petitioner  preferred  Criminal  Appeal  No.40  of  2006 \nbefore  the  Fast  Track  Court,  Tindivanam  as  against  the  aforesaid \nconviction.   The  Criminal  Appeal  was  allowed  on  9.6.2007.   The \npetitioner was taken back to service by an order dated 5.11.2007 and \n3\nhe joined duty on 12.11.2007.\n5. The  first respondent  dropped the departmental proceedings \ninitiated against the petitioner in P.R.No86/99 on the same set of facts \nthat led to filing  of  the criminal case.\n6. The second respondent passed an order  dated 20.5.2008, in \nthe  said  circumstances,  treating the  entire  period of  suspension  as \nduty period and he was paid all  benefits for the period of his non-\nemployment.\n7.   While  so,  the second  respondent  passed an order  dated \n30.5.2008 upgrading the petitioner as Head Constable with effect from \n25.1.1998  on  completion  of  5  years  of  service  as  Grade  I  Police \nConstable.  However, the monetary benefits payable on upgradation as \nHead  Constable  was  denied.   Hence,  the  petitioner  filed \nW.P.No.2705/2009  to  quash  the  order  dated  30.5.2008  and  for  a \nconsequential direction to pay monetary benefits. \n8. The petitioner made a representation dated 28.7.2008 that his \njunior Mr.Mohamed  Yusuf  got promotion to the post of Sub Inspector \n4\nof  Police   and  hence  he  should  also  be  given  promotion  as  Sub \nInspector of Police  with all benefits.\n9.  He sought for upgradation as Special Sub Inspector of Police \non completion of 10 years of service as Head Constable, with effect \nfrom 25.1.2008 pursuant to G.O.Ms.No.937, Home Department dated \n21.7.1998 and also G.O.Ms.No.15, Home Department dated 7.1.2010.\n10. His request was rejected by the second  respondent  by an \norder  dated  25.11.2008  on  the  ground  that  he  suffered  the \npunishment of  reduction in rank for  two years  from Grade I  Police \nConstable to Grade II Police Constable in P.R.No.23/2000 under Rule \n3(b)  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Police  Subordinate  Service  (Discipline  and \nAppeal) Rules by an order dated 19.2.2001  and hence,  he did not \nserve for a period of 10 years as Head Constable for upgradation to \nthe post of Special Sub Inspector of Police.\n11. He preferred an appeal to the first  respondent  against the \naforesaid order dated 25.11.2008.  He wanted promotion from 2004 \nas Sub Inspector of Police as his junior Mohamed Yusuf was promoted \nas Sub Inspector of Police.   He also stated that other  juniors were \n5\npromoted as Sub Inspector and he gave their names.  In any event, \naccording to him, he should have been given upgradation as Special \nSub Inspector of Police on 25.1.2008 on completion of 10 years as \nHead Constable.  The appeal was rejected by the first  respondent by \nan order dated 26.12.2008.\n12. The petitioner, in the circumstances, has filed the first Writ \nPetition  No.2703  of  2009  to  quash  the  aforesaid  order  dated \n25.11.2008  of  the  second   respondent  and  also  the  order  dated \n26.12.2008 of the first  respondent, confirming the order of the second \nrespondent.    He  sought  for  a  direction  to  promote  him  as  Sub \nInspector of Police from 26.1.2000 with all benefits.\n13.   The  respondents  filed  counter  affidavit  refuting  the \nallegations.  They reiterated that there is no illegality in the impugned \norder.\n14. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that he \nshould have been promoted as Sub Inspector of Police from 4.8.2004, \nthe date on which his junior one Mohamed Yusuf was promoted.  The \npetitioner  did  not  participate  in  the  selection  process  during  2004, \n6\nsince he was working only as Grade I  Police Constable.  The Head \nConstables alone could participate in the selection for the post of Sub \nInspector.   Only  in  the  year  2008,   he  was  upgraded  as  Head \nConstable with effect  from 25.1.1998.  Hence, it was not his fault  for \nhis non-participation in the selection process that  took place in the \nyear 2000 and 2012.\n15. The learned counsel for the petitioner also submitted \nthat  in  any  event,  he  is  entitled  to  be  upgraded  as  Special  Sub \nInspector  of  Police  on  completion  of  10  years  of  service  as  Head \nConstable  with  effect  from  25.1.2008,  particularly  when  the  order \ndated 30.5.2008 upgrading him as Head Constable with effect from \n25.1.1998  was  not  cancelled.  The  respondents  are  not  correct  in \npassing the impugned order dated 25.11.2008 in stating that as on \n1.6.2008, the petitioner did not serve 10 years as Head Constable, \nsince he was imposed with the punishment of reduction in rank i.e. \nFrom Grade I Police Constable to Grade II Police Constable, for two \nyears by an order dated 19.2.2001. \n \n16.  After  having  upgraded  him  as  Head  Constable  from \n7\n25.1.1998 as per the order dated 30.5.2008, the respondents are not \ncorrect in stating that two years period of reduction in rank from the \npost  of  Grade  I  Police  Constable  to  Grade  II  Police  Constable  as \nordered in the order dated 19.2.2001, shall be counted as a period \nrendered in the post of  Grade II Police Constable and therefore, the \npetitioner has rendered only 8 years of service as Head Constable.\n17. Further, he has submitted that there is no reason to deny \nthe  petitioner  the  salary  for  the  post  of   Head  Constable  from \n25.1.1998  and the  monetary  benefits  payable  to  the  post  of  Head \nConstable, since he was upgraded by the order dated 30.5.2008 as \nHead Constable with effect from 25.1.1998.  According to him, as on \n25.1.1998, he did not face any criminal proceeding or departmental \nproceedings.  Hence, as on the crucial date of 25.1.1998, as there was \nno proceeding pending against him, he should have been upgraded as \nHead Constable on 25.1.1998.  \n18.  On the  other hand, the learned Special Government Pleader \nseeks dismissal of the Writ Petitions based on the counter affidavit.\n19.  I  have  considered  the  submissions  made  by  the  learned \n8\ncounsel on both sides.\n20. The petitioner joined service as Grade II Police Constable on \n6.12.1975.   He  was  promoted  as  Grade  I  Police  Constable  on \n7.8.1993.   He  was  placed  under  suspension  by  an  order  dated \n17.9.1998  due  to  pendency  of  the  criminal  case.  However,  the \nsuspension was  revoked on 6.2.2001.   While  so,  the criminal  case \nended in  conviction on  21.8.2006.   Hence,  he  was  dismissed  from \nservice  on  29.9.2006.   Later,  the  conviction  was  set  aside  on \n9.6.2007.  Thereafter, he was reinstated in service by an order dated \n5.11.2007.  The Departmental proceeding on the same set of facts, for \nwhich he faced the criminal proceedings, was also dropped by an order \ndated 7.2.2008 of the second  respondent.   These facts are not in \ndispute.\n21.  As  per  G.O.Ms.No.15,  Home Department  dated  7.1.2010, \nGrade I Police Constables who have rendered 5 years of service as \nGrade  I  Police  Constables,  are   upgraded  as  Head  Constables. \nTherefore, the petitioner is entitled to be upgraded as Head Constable \nas on 25.1.1998. He was placed under suspension only on 17.9.1998 \nin  connection  with  the  criminal  case.",

Though the said suit was decreed \nby the trial court on 19.04.2002, the Appellate Court partly allowed \nthe  appeal  by  setting  aside  the  decree  of  permanent  injunction \ngranted  against  the  second  defendant/Tamilnadu  Housing  Board \nrestraining them from executing the sale deed in favour of the first \ndefendant.  However,  the other  part of  the decree of permanent \ninjunction  granted  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff  restraining  the  first \ndefendant  from  interfering  with  her  peaceful  possession  was \nconfirmed.   Further,  the  appeal  preferred  before  this  Court  in \nS.A.No.843 of 2004 came to be dismissed thereby confirming the \norder  of  the First  Appellate  Court.   Thereafter,  both parties filed \napplication  before  the  trial  court  seeking  for  return  of  the \ndocuments.   The  petitioner  as  the  plaintiff  filed  I.A.No.11329  of \n2012, praying for return of documents which are marked as Exs.A1 \nto A24.   The first  respondent  herein  as  the  first  defendant  filed \nI.A.No.8492 of 2012, seeking for return of the documents marked \nas Exs.A6, A7, A11, A14, A15, A16, X1 to X8 and B1 to B24. The \ncourt below by a common order allowed I.A.No.8492 of 2012 filed \nby the first respondent herein and ordered to return the documents \n3\nsought for in the said application.  In so far as the application filed \nby the petitioner herein in I.A.No.11329 of 2012 is concerned, the \ncourt below partly allowed the same and ordered to return Exs.A1 \nto A5, 8 to 10, 12, 13, 17 to 24 and thereby rejecting her prayer for \nreturning of the documents marked under Exs.A6, 7, 11, 14 to 16. \nAggrieved  against  the  said  common  order  passed  by  the  court \nbelow, the present civil revision petitions are filed by the petitioner. \n2.Mr.R.N.Amarnath,  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the \npetitioner  in  both  the  civil  revision  petitions  contended  that  the \ndocuments which are sought to be returned by the petitioner are \nthe documents which are marked by her as the plaintiff before the \ntrial court.  Therefore, when those documents were marked through \nthe plaintiff, it has to be returned only to her and not to the first \ndefendant.  He also relied on the provision under Order 13 Rule 9 \nC.P.C. to contend that the documents have to be returned only to \nthe person who produced the same before the Court.\n3.Per contra, Mr.M.Sriram, learned counsel appearing for \nthe  first  respondent  would  contend  that  though  the  disputed \ndocuments were produced by the plaintiff, in effect, those exhibits \nare documents of title to which the first respondent is entitled to \nhave possession. However, the learned counsel also fairly placed the \n4\nfact that the first respondent had already filed a separate suit in \nO.S.No.936 of 2013 on the file of the XVII Assistant City Civil Court, \nChennai against the petitioner for recovery of those documents from \nthe petitioner herein and the said suit is still pending.\n    4.Considering  the  facts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  and \nconsidering the  arguments  advanced by the  learned counsels  on \neither side, I am of the view that the documents which are marked \nby the petitioner as the plaintiff, has to be necessarily returned only \nto the petitioner and not to the other person in view of the specific \nprovision made under Order 13 Rule 9 C.P.C., wherein it is stated \nthat  any  person  desires  to  receive  back  any  of  the  documents \nproduced by him in the suit, shall be entitled to receive back the \nsame.  \n5.It is an admitted case that the disputed documents were \nmarked only through the plaintiff.  Therefore, the order of the court \nbelow in returning those documents to the first respondent is not \nproper. However, if those documents are in respect of title to the 'B' \nschedule property, as claimed by the first respondent, it is for the \nfirst  respondent  to  seek  possession  of  the  same through proper \ncourse  of  action  which  in  fact,  he  has  taken  already  by  filing  a \nseparate suit.  Whether  he has got a right to seek possession of \nthose documents or not has to be decided only in the said suit which \n5\nis admittedly pending.  Therefore, without prejudice to the rights of \nthe respective parties in the above said suit, the order of the court \nbelow is set  aside and it  is ordered that the petitioner  herein is \nentitled to return of the documents also under Exs.A6, 7, 11,14 to \n16  apart  from  what  was  granted  already.   Accordingly, \nI.A.No.11329 of 2012 is allowed and the order made in I.A.No.8492 \nof 2012 in so far as directing to return Exs.A6, 7, 11, 14 to 16 to \nthe first respondent herein is set aside.  It is made clear that the \norder made in these civil revisions shall not in any way influence the \nmind of the court which is dealing with the suit in O.S.No.936 of \n2013 filed by the first respondent as the same has to be decided on \nits  own  merits  and  in  accordance  with  law.   The  civil  revision \npetitions are disposed of  accordingly.   No costs.   The connected \nmiscellaneous petition is closed.\n30.08.2013\nIndex :Yes/No\nInternet:Yes/No\nvri\n     \n K.RAVICHANDRABAABU,J.\nVRI\n6\nTo\nThe VI Assistant City Civil Court, \nChennai.\nCRP NPD Nos.2746 and 2747 OF 2013\n30.08.2013\n",

C.R.P.(NPD) No.2790 of \n2013 arises out of R.C.O.P.No.1 of 2008 filed under section 14(1)(b) \nof the Tamilnadu Buildings (Lease and Rent Control) Act.  The said \nR.C.O.P. was dismissed and an appeal preferred by the landlord in \nR.C.A.No.1/2011 was allowed. C.R.P.(NPD) No.2791 of 2013 arises \nout of R.C.O.P.No.2/2008 filed under sections 14(1)(b), 10(2)(i) and \n10(2)(ii) of the said Act.  The learned Rent Controller dismissed the \nR.C.O.P. and the appeal by the landlord in R.C.A.No.2/2011 before \nthe  learned  Rent  Control  Appellate  Authority  was  allowed  and \neviction  was  ordered  on  the  grounds  of  Sections  14(1)(b)  and \n10(2)(ii)  and  however  by  rejecting  the  eviction  sought  under \nSection 10(2)(i) of the said Act.  Thus, the aggrieved tenants are \nbefore this Court.\n2.In both these civil revision petitions, the petitioners are \ndifferent tenants and the respondent/landlord is one and the same. \nBoth the tenants are occupying different portions within the same \nbuilding.  Both of them are commonly aggrieved against the order \nof eviction passed under section 14(1)(b).  In so far as the tenant in \nCRP (NPD) No.2791 of 2013 is concerned, the order of eviction was \npassed also on the ground of change of user.  Thus, the validity of \nthe  order  of  eviction  passed  on  the  ground  of  demolition  and \nreconstruction is to be considered first in both these civil revision \n3\npetitions.\n3.The  respondent  herein  filed  the  eviction  petitions  in \nR.C.O.P.Nos.1 and 2 of 2008  on the file of the Rent Controller, \nGobichettipalayam against the petitioners herein respectively.\n4.The case of the landlord is as follows:\nThe  age  of  the  building  is  roughly  90  years  old.   The \nbuilding is in a dilapidated condition and cracks have appeared in \nthe walls.  The petition mentioned property is situated at the center \nof the town in a busy locality and there is a great demand for shops \nin that locality.   Therefore,  the petitioner wants to demolish and \nreconstruct  a  new  modern  and  multistoried  building  so  as  to \naugment his income.  He has made all necessary arrangements to \nput up multistoried building and he has enough funds in the bank \nand financial institutions and also in the name of his mother.  He \nhas prepared a blue print through a competent Civil Engineer for \nsubmitting to Gobi Municipality for getting building plan approval. \nHe has also given an undertaking as contemplated under section \n14(2)(b).\n5.In R.C.O.P.No.2 of 2008, the other ground raised was \nunder section 10(2)(ii)(b).  The contention of the landlord therein is \nthat the tenant occupied the premises for running power press and \n4\nfor  doing  the  business  in  printing.  However,  without  written \nconsent, the tenant started to do the business in fancy materials \nunder  a  different  name  and  style.   The  tenant  has  been  doing \nbusiness in crackers also.  Therefore, the tenant is using the petition \nmentioned building for a purpose other than the one for which it \nwas let out. The said applications were resisted by the tenants. \n6.The learned Rent Controller rejected the applications on \nall the grounds.  The learned Rent Controller rejected the eviction \npetitions by holding that the landlord has not taken any steps to \nvacate other tenants, who are in occupation of the other portions of \nthe same building.  Thus, the learned Rent Controller has found that \nthere is no bonafide.  The learned Rent Controller however, found \nthat by demolishing and reconstructing a new building, the landlord \nwould  get  more  income  and  therefore,  there  is  a  possibility  of \naugmentation of his income.  He also found that the building is old \nand safer only to an extent of 50%.  The learned Rent Controller \nfurther found that the petitioner/landlord is having enough source of \nfund for reconstructing a new building.  At paragraph No.41 of his \norder, the learned Rent Controller has observed as follows:\n\"41.nkw;go tptu';fspypUe;J kDr; brhj;jpy; \ncs;s  kDf;  fl;ol';fis  ,oj;Jtpl;L  g[jpjhf fl;Lkhd';fs; \nbra;tjw;fhf vjph;kDjhuh;fis btspnaw;w ntz;Lbkd;W \n5\n,k;kDf;fs; jhf;fy; bra;ag;gl;Ls;snghJ. kDf; fl;ol';fs; \n50  my;yJ 60  Mz;LfSf;F nkyhd gHikahd  fl;ol';fs; \nvd;w  nghjpYk;.  kDf;  fl;ol';fis  ,oj;Jtpl;L  g[jpjhf \nfl;Lkhd';fs;  bra;a  kDjhuh;  epjp  trjp \nbgw;wpUf;fpwhh; vd;w nghjpYk;. kDr; brhj;jpy; \ng[jpajhf fl;Lkhd';fs; bra;tjw;F nghjpa tiuglk; jhf;fy; \nbra;jpUf;fpwhh; vd;wnghjpYk;. nkw;go  fhuz';fs; \nmidj;Jk; kDr;brhj;jpy; cs;s  fl;ol';fis ,oj;Jtpl;L g[jpjhf \nfl;Lkhd';fs;  bra;tjw;fhf  vjph;kDjhuh;fis \nbtspnaw;Wtjw;F  ,k;kDf;fis  jhf;fy;  bra;Js;shh; \nvd;W ehk; fUj KoahJ/ Vbddpy;.

The Appellate Authority has thus found \nat paragraph No.17 of his judgment that when the other tenants \nhave already agreed to vacate the petition premises which are in \ntheir respective possession, there is no necessity for the landlord to \ntake steps against them for eviction.\n9.Learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners  vehemently \ncontended that filing of an eviction petition only against these two \npetitioners  on  the  ground  of  demolition  and  reconstruction  is \nwithout bonafide when there are other tenants.  According to him, \nthe  landlord  should  have  filed  eviction  petition  against  all  the \ntenants. ",

Respondent\n Criminal Original Petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code \nof Criminal Procedure, praying to call for the records in C.C.No.18 of \n2008 on the file of the Judicial Magistrate No.I, Attur, Salem District \nand to quash the same insofar as the petitioners are concerned.\nFor Petitioners   : Mr.R.Karthikeyan\nFor Respondent : Mr.V.Arul, G.A (Crl.Side) \nO R D E R\nThe petitioners 1 to 3 are arrayed as A1 to A3 in CC.No.18 of \n2008 on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.I, Attur, Salem District. \n2.The present petition is filed to quash the criminal proceedings \ninitiated  against  the  petitioners.  The  petitioners  herein  are  the \nlicensee-cum-owner  of  Sri  Ranga  Trading  Company  and  owners  of \nK.M.S. Enterprises. The respondent Food Inspector has made surprise \n2\ncheque at 5.00pm on 26.2.2007 to Sri Ranga Trading company, where \nhe took samples of Shri Jayam Sambar Dhall, after duly serving Form \nVI  on  the  owner  of  the  shop  and  the  samples  were  also,  after \ncomplying with all the legal formalities, sent for examination to Public \nAnalyst, who after conducting analysis, sent his report as follows:\nExamination of the Label:\npictures printed on Tomato, beans, As per Rule 37 of PFA\nthe sample packet carrot, drum stick Rules 1955, a label\nbrinjal and nollogal shall not contain any\ndesign device which is\nfalse or misleading\nin any particulars\nconcerning the food\ncontained in the\npackage.\nOpinion: I am of the opinion that the sample misbranded as it is not \nlabelled in accordance with the requirements of with Rule 37 of PFA \nRules 1955.\n3.The respondent-Food inspector has, on the basis of the Public \nAnalyst  report,  approached  the  Director  of  Public  Health  and \nPreventive Medicine for  appropriate sanction for  lodging prosecution \nagainst the licensee, dealer and manufacturer of the food item and \nafter obtaining sanction, criminal prosecution was lodged against the \npetitioners herein for the offences under Sections 7(ii) and 16(i)(a)(i) \nr/w Section 2(ix)(g) and (k) of  Prevention of Food Adulteration Act \n1954 (hereinafter shortly called as 'Act') and Rule 37 of the Prevention \nof Food Adulteration Rules, 1955 (hereinafter shortly called as 'Rules'). \n3\nAccording to the prosecution, the pictures printed on the label of the \nabove  mentioned  items  are  false  or  misleading  amounting  to \nmisbranding, which is in contravention of the relevant provisions of law \nas referred to above. On receipt of the summons, A1 to A3 have come \nforward with the present petition to quash the proceedings initiated \nagainst them.\n4.It is contended on the side of the petitioners that the opinion \nof the Public Analyst is baseless and unfounded and is not supported \nby any details or reasoning as to how the names of the vegetables \nmentioned in the label is false or misleading. It is sought to be argued \nthat the purpose for which the vegetables are mentioned, is to show \nthat the article of food is used for cooking the vegetables shown in the \npicture and the same cannot be said to be exonerating or misleading \nthe quality of the foods item in question.\n5.Heard both sides.\n6.In order to better appreciate the argument advanced on both \nsides,  it  is  but  relevant  to  look  into  Rule  37,  which  is  extracted \nhereunder:\n\"37.Labels  not  to  contain  false  or  misleading \nstatements:\nA  label  shall  not  contain  any  statement,  claim, \ndesign, device, fancy name or abbreviation which is false \nor  misleading  in  any  particular  concerning  the  food \n4\ncontained in the package, or concerning the quantity or the \nnutritive value or in relation to the place of origin of the \nsaid food:\n(Provided that this rule shall not apply in respect of \nestablished trade or fancy names of confectionery, biscuits \nand  sweets  such  as  Barley,  Sugar,  Bulls,  Ice-cream \ncracker,  or  in  respect  of  aerated waters  such as Ginger \nBeer  or  Gold  Spot  or  any  other  name  in  existence  in  \ninternational trade practice.)\"\n7.In this case,   the label  of  the packet does not contain any \nother statement except the picture of the vegetables and the same \ncannot be at any strength of imagination construed to be either false \nor misleading or concerning the quantity or the nutritive value of the \nfood  contained  in  the  packet.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  the \njudgment reported in (2008) 4 SCC 584 (Parakh Foods Limited v. \nState  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  another)  under  identical \ncircumstances, while dealing with the pictures of vegetables printed on \nthe label of Soyabean oil, has observed that \"the same do not in any \nway indicate  the  quality  of   soyabean oil  as  'super  refined',  'extra \nrefined',  'micro  refined',  'double  refined',  ultra  refined',  'anti-\nCholesterol',  'cholesterol  fighter',  'soothing  to  heart',  'cholesterol \nfriendly',  'saturated  fat  free'  etc.  nor  it  indicates  the  exaggeration \ntowards the quality of theproduct tocome within the mischief of Rule \n37D  of  the  PFA  Rules.  The  Supreme  Court,  by  observing  so,  was \npleased to disagree with the finding of the High Court that the article \n5\nof food (soyabean oil)  was misbranded. The ratio laid down by the \nHon'ble Supreme court was also followed by the learned brother Judge \n(SNJ) in the order dated 19.11.2011 made in Crl.O.P.No.1944/2009, \nwhich was filed by one S.Anbumane and M/s.Asian Dhall  Industries \nLimited, who was arrayed as A4 and A5 in CC.No.18 of 2008, for the \nsame  relief.  The  learned  brother  Judge,  having  observed  that  the \nmatter printed on the label was neither false nor misleading and the \nsame  could  not  be  in  violation  of  Rule  37  so  as  to  sustain  the \nprosecution, has quashed the proceedings against A4 and A5. In my \nconsidered  view,  the  same  benefit  shall  also  be  extended  to  the \npetitioners  herein,  who  are  the  accused  1  to  3  in  the  same \nproceedings.\n8.Hence,  this  Criminal  Original  Petition  is  allowed  and  the \nproceedings in C.C.No.18/2008 on the file of Judicial Magistrate No.I, \nAttur, Salem stands quashed insofar as the petitioners/A1 to A3 are \nconcerned.

Petitioner \n    \nVs.\nM/s.ICICI Bank Ltd\nrep. by its Authorised signatory,\nMr.R.Divakar                 ..  Respondent\n Criminal Original Petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code \nof Criminal Procedure, praying to call for the records and quash the \ncomplaint  in  CC.No.4316  of  2007  on the  file  of  the  X Metropolitan \nMagistrate, Egmore, Chennai.\nFor Petitioner   : Mr.Akbar Ali Dhale, \nFor Respondent : T.Muruganantham\nO R D E R\nHeard both sides.\n2.The petitioner herein, who is the sole accused in CC.No.4316 \nof 2007 on the file of X Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai, has \ncome forward with the present petition to quash the proceedings.\n2\n3.The relief sought for by the petitioner is mainly on the ground \nthat  the  private  complaint  filed  by  the  respondent  against  the \npetitioner  for  the  offences  under  Sections  406  and  420  IPC is  not \nsustainable as there is no element of cheating either in obtaining the \npersonal loan or in complying with the conditions for issuance of such \nloan  and  the  offences  under  Sections  406  and  420  IPC cannot  be \nattracted for mere non payment of loan, which is only an actionable \nclaim to be agitated before the civil court of law. \n4.The learned counsel  for  the petitioner  has in support  of  his \ncontention also cited the authority  reported  in  (2009) 1 MLJ 352 \n(P.Ashok Kumar and another v. Inspector of Police, Crime, V3 \nJ.J.Nagar  Police Station,  Chennai),  wherein,  the learned brother \njudge R.Regupathi, J., was pleased to heavily comment upon the illegal \npractice  of  the  Magistrates  in  referring  the  civil  disputes  for  police \ninvestigation or taking cognizance by themselves, by illegally imputing \ncriminal  flavour  to  civil  disputes.  The  learned  brother  Judge  has \nexpressed  his  anguish  over  such  action  of  the  Magistrates  and \nobserved that such action is not only inappropriate, but also legally \nuntenable. The learned brother Judge has also gone to the extent of \nsaying that the same elicited their unwanted intention to aid one party \nand  to  intimidate  the  other  party.  The  learned  brother  Judge  has \nconsidered  the  pendency  of  number  of  cases  against  borrowers  in \n3\nvarious courts, even beyond territorial jurisdiction and having recorded \nthe conduct of financial institution in approaching the Magistrates to \nprocure an order so that they can extract through police the principal \namount and whatever rate of interest they charge from the borrowers, \nexpressed his anguish in very strong language and found fault with the \nMagistrates, who failed to follow the guidelines issued by the Hon'ble \nApex court for exercising greater caution in this regard. The learned \nbrother Judge, on the basis of statistics furnished to the Court, has \nfound that  the  immersion  of  civil  disputes  with  criminal  charges  is \nimmensely growing with each passing day and in the opinion of this \ncourt, the same is humanly not possible, if there is proper application \nof  mind  and  taking  cognisance  by  the  Magistrates  is  on  the  mere \nrequest of the Bankers with an ulterior motive and in collusion and \nconspiracy  with  them  and  such  illegal  practice  has  made  by  the \nMagistrate Courts breeding points of pendency of unnecessary criminal \ncases reflecting its adverse effect at all levels upto the Supreme Court. \nIn  the  light  of  the  detailed  discussion  made  therein,  the  learned \nbrother Judge issued the following directions:\n“(i)The Registry is directed to withdraw all the cases \npending  on  the  file  of  the  learned  Magistrates  vide \nAnnexure A, B and C of the Vigilance Report and call for all  \nthe  records  connected  to  those  cases  and  transfer  the \nsame to the file of the High Court, Madras.\n4\n(ii)Registry  to  place  the  entire  materials  and \nparticulars  before  the  Hon'ble  the  chief  Justice  so  that \norders  could  be  passed  for  conducting  enquiry  in  those \nmatters.\n(iii)Further  proceedings  of  all  those  cases  vide \nAnnexure  A,  B  and  C  pending  on  the  file  of  the \nMetropolitan/Judicial  Magistrates  concerned  are  hereby \nstayed till the disposal of the proceedings by the Court;\n(iv)All  records including vigilance reports  may also \nbe placed before the Hon'ble the Chief Justice for taking \nappropriate  departmental  action  against  the  Magistrates \nconcerned in particular III, X, XVII and XVIII Metropolitan \nMagistrates,  Chennai  and  Judicial  Magistrate-III, \nCoimbatore and Judicial Magistrate Paramakudi, Ramnad; \nand\n(v)in view of the orders passed for transfer of the \npending cases before the Metropolitan/Judicial Magistrate \nCourts  to the  file  of  this  Court,  the Director  General  of  \nPolice is directed to instruct\n(a)the police officers, who have received orders from \nthe Magistrates in such cases under Section 156(3) Cr.P.C \nand  (b)the  Station  House  Officers,  who  have  directly \nentertained  similar  complaints  in  the  name  of  “petition \nenquiry”\nto  obtain  opinion  from  the  Director  General/Additional \nDirector  General  of  prosecutions/Assistant  Public \nProsecutors etc and to file interim/final reports before the \njurisdiction Magistrates within a period of two weeks from \ntoday.\n5\nCompliance report is to be filed in this regard within three \nweeks by the Director General of Police.”\n5.The present case, as rightly pointed out by the learned counsel \nfor the petitioner, is one such case, wherein, mere non payment of \npersonal  loan  is  given  the  colour  of  criminality,  as  such,  the  view \nexpressed  by  the  High  court  in  the  case  cited  above  is  squarely \napplicable to the facts of the present case, wherein the liability is more \nof civil in nature and in the absence of any allegations regarding any \nact of forgery of any records or violation of any conditions of issuance \nof personal loan the ingredients for the offences charged against the \npetitioner  are  not  attracted  and  in  the  event  of  the  proceedings \ninitiated against the petitioner, which is otherwise bad in law, being \nallowed to continue, the same amounts to abuse of process of law and \nthe proceedings is hence, liable to be set aside.    \n6.Even otherwise, the learned counsel for the respondent in the \ncourse of hearing, has given an undertaking to withdraw the private \ncomplaint filed before the concerned Magistrate Court and based on \nthe same, he prayed to dispose of this quash petition. He also made an \nendorsement to that effect in the bundle. In view of the above findings \nand also in view of the undertaking given by the learned counsel for \nthe respondent, this Criminal Original Petition is liable to be ordered.\n6\n       K.B.K.VASUKI, J.\nrk\n7.In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the \nproceedings  in  CC.No.4316/2007  on  the  file  of  the  X  Metropolitan \nMagistrate, Egmore, Chennai stands quashed. \n               16-07-2013\nrk\nIndex:Yes/No\nInternet:Yes/no\nTo\nThe X Metropolitan Magistrate, Egmore, Chennai.\n  Crl.O.P.No.3739 of 2009\n",

Respondents\n(R2 impleaded as per the order of this court\ndated 2.4.2008 made in M.P.No.2 of 2008)\n Criminal Original Petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code \nof  Criminal  Procedure,  pleased  to  call  for  the  order  in \nRC.No.6800/07/A1 dated 03.03.2008 passed by the respondent and to \nquash the same.\nFor Petitioner   : M/s.Sundar Mohan\nFor Respondents : Mr.V.Arul, G.A (Crl.Side) -R1\n  Mr.Elango -R2\nO R D E R\nHeard all.\n2.This  petition  is  filed  to  quash  the  proceedings  in \nRC.No.6800/07/A1  dated  3.3.2008  passed  by  the  first \nrespondent/Revenue Divisional Officer and Sub Divisional Magistrate, \nPonneri. \n                                                                  2\n3.The impugned order proceeds as if the petitioner herein has \ncaused obstruction to persons using the Plan Marked channel (g{!;jpjp \ntha;f;fhy;)  in S.Nos.747, 745, 744, 722, 721, 719, 718, 713 of Vallur \nVillage, Ponneri Taluk by putting up wall, which causes obstruction and \nthe petitioner is by the same impugned order directed to remove the \nobstruction in the land in question within 10 days or to appear before \nthe Sub Divisional Magistrate, Ponneri on 13.3.2008 to show cause as \nto why the order should not be enforced. \n4.The  petitioner  has  challenged  the  impugned  order  on  the \nground  that  the  impugned  order  does  not  in  compliance  with \nmandatory requirement disclose the facts and reasons on the basis of \nwhich, the first respondent/Revenue Divisional Officer arrived at such \nconclusion that the petitioner has caused obstruction by way of putting \nup wall in the order mentioned survey numbers. The learned counsel \nfor the petitioner, in support of his contention, also cited the authority \nreported  in  2008 (2)  MWN (Cr.)  383 (The Manager,  Kodanad \nEstate, Kothagiri Taluk v. the Sub Divisional Magistrate and the \nAssistant Collector, Coonoor, the Nilgiris District).\n5.The learned Government Advocate (Crl.Side) representing the \nfirst  respondent,  whose  order  is  under  challenge  herein  and  the \nlearned counsel for the second respondent, who made the complaint \n                                                                  3\nagainst  the  so  called  obstruction,  would  attempt  to  defend  the \ncorrectness and validity of the order, on the ground that the Revenue \nDivisional Officer is empowered to pass one such order and to initiate \nproceedings  under  Section  133  Cr.P.C  and  the  impugned  order  is \nbased on materials to substantiate the obstruction etc.\n6.This court is not inclined to accept the contention so raised on \nthe side of the respondents 1 and 2. It cannot be disputed that the \nfirst respondent Revenue Divisional Officer, is under section 133 Cr.P.C \nempowered by the State Government,  on receiving the report  of  a \npolice officer or other information and on taking such evidence if any \nas he thinks fit, to consider that any unlawful obstruction or nuisance \nshould be removed and he may make a conditional order requiring the \nperson  causing  such  obstruction  etc.,  to  remove  such  obstruction \nwithin a time to be fixed in the order. \n7.In the present case,  the information was received from the \nTahsildar,  Ponneri  on 16.10.2007  and the  same proceeds  as  if  the \ncomplaint  was  received  from various  pattadars  that  one  Devadoss \nReddy, owner of M/s.T.R.Logistics has put up compound wall, thereby \nencroaching upon pathway and causing obstruction to other pattadars \nto use  such pathway and inspection was  conducted  based on such \ncomplaints, but the measurements could not be taken. On the basis of \n                                                                  4\nsuch  report,  notice  dated  11.12.2007  was  issued  by  the  first \nrespondent  to one Tulasi  Narayanan,  District  President,  Tamil  Nadu \nFarmers Society, Ponneri and Devadoss Reddy through the Tahsildar, \nPonneri  to  appear  for  enquiry on 17.12.2007,  the copy of which is \nenclosed at page 6 of the typed set of papers filed along with this \nCriminal Original Petition. The second notice dated 20.12.2007 for the \nhearing on 7.1.2008 was also issued to the petitioners and others in \nthis  regard.  Whereas,  the  impugned  order  came  to  be  passed  on \n3.3.2008 and the same does not disclose as to whether and as to what \nis the outcome of the enquiry in this regard and the impugned order is \nnot based on any finding arrived at by the Revenue officials in the \ncourse of such enquiry.\n8.As rightly argued by the learned counsel for the petitioner, the \nimpugned order is passed without any basis and is not supported by \nany finding arrived at in the enquiry, as such, the impugned order is, \nfor want of one such finding, vitiated as baseless and unfounded. The \nfirst respondent/Revenue Divisional Officer has in my considered view \ntotally erred in passing one such order without completing the enquiry \nand  without  arriving  at  proper  conclusion  and  without  rendering  a \nspecific  finding  and  without  disclosing  the  finding  in  the  impugned \norder. \n                                                                  5\n9.The argument raised on the side of the petitioner against the \nvalidity of the impugned order is also fortified by the judgment of our \nHigh court in  2008 (2) MWN (Cr) 383 (The Manager, Kodanad \nEstate, Kothagiri Taluk v. the Sub Divisional Magistrate and the \nAssistant  Collector,  Coonoor,  the Nilgiris  District)  wherein  our \nHigh Court  has  dealt  with  the  scope  of  enquiry  under  Section  133 \nCr.P.C in the light of the Judgment of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and \nthe judgments of other High courts.  The learned brother judge in para \n12.1 laid down the proposition of law emerged through the decisions of \nthe Apex court and other High courts, which is extracted here under:\n“(a)The  order  under  Section  133  Cr.P.C  must  be \nbased upon material factors.\n(b)The order should be reasonable restriction and it \nmust not be arbitrary or excessive and the procedure and \nthe manner of  imposition of  restriction must be fair  and \njust.\n(c)Proceedings  under  Section  133  Cr.P.C  are  not \nintended  to  settle  private  disputes  between  different \nmembers of public.\n(d)Unless there  is  imminent danger to the physical \ncomfort  of  the  community,  the  order  under  Section 133 \nCr.P.C cannot be passed.\n(e)No action can be taken when the obstruction has \nbeen in existence for a long period and Section 133 Cr.P.C \nis  attracted  only  in  case  of  emergency  and  imminent \ndanger.\n                                                                  6\n(f)The proceedings under Section 133 Cr.P.C is not a \nsubstitute for the Civil Proceedings.\n(g)For  invoking  Section  133  Cr.P.C  there  must  be \nimminent  danger  to  the  property  and  consequential  \nnuisance to the public.\n(h)The  exercise  of  the  power  should  be  one  of \njudicious  discretion  objectively  exercised  on  pragmatic \nconsideration  of  the  given  facts  and  circumstances  from \nevidence on record.”\nOur High court has, by appreciating the issue involved therein in the \nlight of the principles so laid down, observed in para 12.6 of the same \njudgment  that  Section  133  Cr.P.C  provides  summary  remedy  and \ninvolves a sense of emergency and the same cannot be used or rather \nmisused when the valuable right of the owner of the property is at \nstake.  It  is  further  observed  therein  that  any  order  passed  under \nSection 133 Cr.P.C is based on evidence and when the evidence does \nnot disclose any imminent danger to public tranquility or peace, the \npower under Section 133 Cr.P.C cannot be used or rather misused.\n10.The impugned order herein, if appreciated in the light of the \nproposition laid down above, would disclose that the same is not based \non any material and the same is the outcome of total non application \nof mind. As rightly observed by our High court in the decision cited \nabove, considering the nature of the dispute, the respondent ought to \n                                                                  7\nhave referred the parties to civil court of law and ought not to have \nresorted to such shortcut method of passing the impugned order for \nresolving the dispute between the parties. Hence, the impugned order \nis bad in law and is not in accordance with the procedure laid down \nunder law and the same is liable to be quashed.\n11.In the result, this Criminal Original Petition is allowed and the \norder  made  in  RC.No.6800/07/A1  dated  03.03.2008  passed  by  the \nfirst  respondent/Revenue  Divisional  Officer  and  Sub  Divisional \nMagistrate, Ponneri, Thriuvallur District stands quashed. However, the \nparties are at liberty to approach the civil forum to resolve the dispute \nbetween  them.

Pleader\n2\nO R D E R\nThe writ petition is  filed challenging the  order of removal from \nservice.\n 2. The writ petitioner's husband was   serving as cook in the \nGovernment Rajaji Hospital, Madurai and died on  3.10.1989 while he \nwas in service. Consequent  to his death, the petitioner was appointed \nas sanitary worker   on compassionate grounds through proceedings \ndated  8.10.1990.   After   10  years  of  service,  the petitioner   was \nserved with a show cause notice  on  22.6.2000 by  calling upon her to \nexplain as to  why suitable action should not be  taken for  having \nsubmitted  bogus educational qualification  certificate  at the time of \nher appointment.  Thereafter, an enquiry was conducted  and based on \nthe  enquiry  report, the  impugned order  of removal from service \ncame to be passed against the petitioner.   The petitioner challenged \nthe said order on several grounds.\n 3.   It is contended by  her that the disciplinary proceedings \nwere initiated  with  a delay of more than 10 years from the alleged \ndelinquency  and  therefore  the  petitioner  was  reasonably  prevented \nfrom making  her   defence.   It  is  further  stated  that  the  requisite \n3\nqualification for the  post of sanitary worker  is  only to read and write \nand therefore the contention of the respondents  that the petitioner \nhad  produced  the  bogus  certificate   has  no  relevance  to  the \nemployment given to the petitioner.  In other words,  it is the case \nof  the  petitioner  that  she  was  not   gainfully  employed  due  to  the \ncertificate produced by her.   It is further contended that the enquiry \nwas  not  properly  conducted  by  the  authority  as  no  witness   was \nexamined  on  behalf  of   the  prosecution  and  no  documents  were \nmarked in the enquiry.\n4.  The respondents have filed a counter affidavit and contended \nthat the  petitioner produced a certificate at the time of availing the \nemployment, as if she has  passed 6th standard and on verification it \nwas  found that the said certificate  was not a genuine one . Thus,  the \nrespondents supported the impugned order.\n 5. Heard the learned counsel for either side.\n 6.  The petitioner was admittedly appointed  on compassionate \ngrounds  as  sanitary  worker.  There  is  no  dispute  that  the  requisite \neducational qualification for being appointed as sanitary worker is  that \nthe candidate  must be able to read and write in Tamil.  Therefore, it is \ncrystal  clear  that  the  petitioner  was  appointed  not  based  on  the \n4\ncertificate produced by her which is alleged to be a bogus one since \nthe basic requirement is that the petitioner should be able to    read \nand write  in Tamil.  It is not the case of the respondents that the \npetitioner is not having  even such  qualification.  On the other hand, \ntheir case is that the petitioner produced bogus certificate.  However, \nthe fact  remains  that  the petitioner  has not obtained employment \nshowing the  said certificate  as the qualification,  which is admittedly \nnot the requisite one for the post of sanitary  worker.  Therefore, in my \nconsidered view, the respondents are not justified in passing the order \nof punishment   that too  imposing a major penalty of removal  from \nservice by initiating a proceedings  after nearly 10 years from the date \nof  appointment.    The  petitioner  got  the  said  appointment  on  the \ncompassionate  grounds   after  having   lost  her  husband,  who  was \nworking  as  Cook  in  the  Govt.  Rajaji  Hospital,  Madurai.  The  family \ncircumstances of the petitioner is also to be taken into consideration. \n 7. In similar circumstances,  the Hon'ble Division Bench of this \nCourt  passed an order  in  W.P.No.  32129  of  2004 dated 27.8.2008 \n(K.Sundaramoorthy  Vs.  Union  of  India  and  others)   by  directing \nreinstatement of the employee with continuity of  service, however, \nwithout  backwages.  The relevant paragraphs  4  to 7  are  extracted \n5\nhereunder:-\n\"4.  Learned  counsel  appearing  for \nrespondents  1  to  3  submitted  that  since  the \npetitioner had produced a false certificate and the \ndelinquency  was  proved  in  properly   conducted \ndepartmental  proceedings,  there  is  no  scope  to \ninterfere with the order passed by the Tribunal.  \n5.   Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for \nboth  parties  at  length  and  having  given  our \nanxious  consideration  to  the  facts  and \ncircumstances  of  the  case,  we  feel  that  the \npunishment  of removal from service, which has \nthe effect of depriving the petitioner of his means \nof  livelihood,  is  grossly  disproportionate.  We \nventure to  so  observe so,  keeping in view the \nnature of the post and the status of the petitioner. \nWe also feel that  since the petitioner  had not \nderived any particular advantage by producing the \nfalse certificate,  the explanation of the petitioner \nthat it was produced under a bona fide mistaken \nadvice  as  the  original  certificate  was  not \nimmediately  available,  is  acceptable.   In  those \ncircumstances,  we feel that instead of removing \nthe  petitioner  from  service,  some  lesser \npunishment can be imposed.\n6. We are conscious of the position of law \nthat ordinarily the discretion of the departmental \nauthorities  relating  to  imposition  of  punishment \n6\nshould not be interfered with by the court of law \nunless  such  punishment   is  grossly \ndisproportionate.  We are  also  conscious   of  the \nposition that ordinarily  while interfering in such \nmatter, the matter is required to be remanded   to \nthe  departmental   authority  for  imposing  any \nadequate punishment.  However,  in the peculiar \nfacts and circumstances of this case,  particularly, \nwhen we find that the order of removal had been \npassed in the year 1999,  in order  to avoid any \nfurther  delay,  we  feel  it  would  be  more \nappropriate to finalise the matter in this Court. \n7.  Accordingly, while setting aside the order \nof  removal   from  service,  we  direct  that  the \npetitioner  shall  be  reinstated  in  service. \nObviously,   he  shall  not  be  entitled  to  any \nbackwages nor such period shall  be counted for \nthe  purpose  of  notional  increments.   However, \nsuch period shall  be counted for  the purpose of \ncontinuity in service including for the purpose of \npensionary  benefits.   This  order  shall  be \nimplemented  by  respondents   1  to  3  within  a \nperiod of 30 days from the date of production of a \ncopy  of  this  order  by  the  petitioner   to  the \nrespondents.\"\n  8.  After perusing the said order of the Hon'ble Division  Bench \nrelied on by the learned counsel for the petitioner, I am of the view \n7\nthat  the  case  on  hand   is  squarely  covered  by  the  said  decision. \nAccordingly,  I   set  aside  the  impugned  order  and  direct  the \nrespondents to reinstate  the petitioner into service  with the benefit of \ncontinuity  of  service   for  the  purpose  of  pensionary  benefits  . \nHowever, the petitioner is  not entitled to  any backwages  nor the \nperiod during which  she was out of service shall be counted for the \npurpose of notional increments. \n  9.

Through  the  said  impugned  order  dated \n03.04.2000,  the  second  respondent  rejected  the  request  of  the \npetitioner for payment of salary as Grade I Tamil Pandit with effect \nfrom the date of his appointment viz., 03.12.1971 as Grade II Tamil \nPandit.  \n2.The case of the petitioner is as follows:\n  The petitioner was originally appointed as Grade II Tamil \nPandit at the fourth respondent school on 03.12.1971, though he \nwas  possessing  qualification  to  be  appointed  as  Grade  I  Tamil \nPandit.  A large number of Grade II Tamil Pandits who were fully \nqualified to be appointed as Grade I Tamil Pandits were continuing \nas Grade II Tamil Pandits at various schools by drawing the Grade II \nscale of pay like the petitioner.  They made a representation to the \nGovernment  and  based  on  such  representation,  G.O.Ms.No.325, \nEducation  Department  dated  25.02.1971,  came  to  be  passed \nthrough which,  the  Government  sanctioned the  creation of  2000 \nposts of Grade I Tamil Pandits by converting 2000 posts of Grade II \nTamil Pandits in order to absorb Grade II Tamil Pandits, who are \nworking in  the  schools  with  full  qualification to  hold  the  post  of \nGrade I Tamil Pandits.  Subsequently, another 260 posts of Grade I \nTamil  Pandits  were  created  by  G.O.Ms.No.1724  Education \n3\nDepartment dated 28.10.1972.  One more G.O. came to be passed \nin  G.O.Ms.No.1484  Education  Department  dated  28.08.1973 \nthrough which, another 240 posts of Grade I Tamil Pandits were \ncreated.   Only  in  pursuant  to  the  said  G.O.Ms.No.1484,  the \npetitioner got the benefit of  upgradation as Grade I Tamil Pandit \nwith effect from 28.08.1973.  The petitioner by accepting the said \nupgradation  with  effect  from the  said  date  of  G.O.  received  the \nsalary  and  after  working  in  such  capacity,  also  retired  on \n31.05.2000.   However,  while  he  was  in  service,  he  made  a \nrepresentation on 26.12.1996 i.e., after nearly 23 years from the \ndate of upgradation of his post as Grade I Tamil Pandit, seeking for \npayment of  salary as Grade I  Tamil  Pandit  from the date of  his \nappointment viz.,03.12.1971.  The said representation came to be \nmade by him based on another G.O. passed in G.O.Ms.No.119, Adi-\nDravidar and Tribal Welfare Department dated 20.06.1995.  Under \nthe  said  G.O.,  the  Government  accepted  the  suggestions  of  the \nDirector of Adi-Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department and directed \nthat 240 teachers who were qualified for Secondary Grade Posts but \nwere  acting  as  Higher  Grade  Teacher  from  01.01.1971  to \n02.10.1973 be allowed Secondary Grade scale of  pay with effect \nfrom 01.01.1971 or from the date of their appointment whichever is \nlater.   Thus,  the  petitioner  claimed the  salary  as  Grade  I  Tamil \npandit from 03.12.1971 onwards.  It is his contention that he should \n4\nalso be given similar benefit as given to the Higher Grade Teachers \nwho possessed Secondary Grade qualification.  The said request of \nthe petitioner was rejected by the impugned order by holding that \nthe said G.O. upgrading the petitioner's post from Grade II to Grade \nI was issued on 28.08.1973 and only from the date of the said G.O., \nthe upgradation was effected and the petitioner was also given the \nbenefit and therefore, the request for payment of salary as Grade I \nTamil  Pandit  with  effect  from 03.12.1971,  cannot  be  considered. \nAgainst the said order, the present writ petition is filed.\n3.Learned counsel  for  the petitioner  would contend that \nthe petitioner is also similarly situated person like that of the other \nHigher Grade Teachers who got the benefit under G.O.Ms.No.119, \nAdi-Dravidar and Tribal Welfare Department dated 20.06.1995 and \ntherefore, he should be given the benefit. The petitioner also relied \non G.O.Ms.No.347 Education Department dated 15.09.1998.\n4.Per contra, the third respondent filed a counter affidavit \nand submitted that the petitioner was promoted as Grade I Tamil \nPandit  as  per  the  orders  of  the  Government  passed  in \nG.O.Ms.No.1484 Education Department dated 28.08.1973 and when \nthe petitioner was admittedly working as a Tamil Pandit and not as \nSecondary Grade Teacher, he cannot seek any benefit arising out of \n5\nG.O.Ms.No.347 Education Department dated 15.09.1998.\n5.Heard the learned counsels appearing on either side.\n6.The petitioner herein was admittedly appointed as Grade \nII Tamil Pandit in the fourth respondent school on 03.12.1971.  His \npost was upgraded as Grade I Tamil Pandit only with effect from \n28.08.1973.  It is an admitted fact that the petitioner, accepting the \nsaid upgradation with effect from 28.08.1973, received the salary \nonly from the said date as Grade I Tamil Pandit without any protest \nand  also  retired  on  30.05.2000.   No  doubt,  he  has  made  a \nrepresentation in the year 1996 based on a G.O. came to be passed \nin  the  year  1995  viz.,  G.O.Ms.No.119,  Adi-Dravidar  and  Tribal \nWelfare Department dated 20.06.1995.\n7.In my considered view, the very claim of the petitioner \nmade after nearly 23 years, that too, based on a G.O. passed in the \nyear 1995, i.e., passed after 22 years from the date of upgradation, \ncannot be relied upon by the petitioner to seek a benefit especially, \nwhen the said G.O. is not specifically referable to the posts of Tamil \nPandit.   Admittedly,  the  said G.O.   came to  be passed  only  in \nrespect of Higher Grade Teachers  who   were  working   with  the \nqualification   of   Secondary Grade Teacher  at  the  Adi  Dravidar \n6\nWelfare School.  Thus, the petitioner cannot seek any benefit out of \nthe said G.O..  Even otherwise, when the upgradation was effected \nonly  through  G.O.Ms.No.1484  Education  Department  dated \n28.08.1973  by  creation  of  240  posts  of  Grade  I  Tamil  Pandits \nnecessarily, the pay has to be paid only from the date of creation of \nthe posts with upgradation as Grade I Tamil Pandits.  Moreover, the \npetitioner made the claim nearly after 23 years. Such time barred \nclaim cannot  be  entertained  even  assuming  that  the  petitioner's \nclaim has some merits. Under such circumstances, I am of the view \nthat  the  petitioner's  claim was  rightly  rejected  by the  impugned \norder with which I find no infirmity.  Accordingly, the writ petition \ndeserves no merit and the same is dismissed.

Respondents \nThis writ petition is filed under Article 226 of the \nConstitution of India praying for the issuance of a Writ of \nMandamus  to  direct  the  respondents  to  consider  the \n2\nobjections  filed  by  the  petitioners  on  7.12.2005, \n28.12.2005,  29.12.2005,  5.1.2006  and  18.1.2006  seeking \ncompensation for our property situated at Sy.No.125/1B1B of \nKoyambedu Village, Egmore, Nungambakkam Taluk, Chennai. \nFor petitioners : Mr.V.Raghavachari\n     For respondent  : Mr.R.Raeswaran\n   Special Government Pleader \nO R D E R\nThe  petitioners  are  seeking  for  a  writ  of  Mandamus \ndirecting the respondents to consider the objection filed \nby them seeking compensation for their property situated at \nsurvey  No.125/1B1B  of  Koyambedu  Village,  Egmore, \nNungambakkm Taluk, Chennai. \n2. The case of the petitioner is that they are the \nowners  of  the  property  referred  supra  by  purchasing  the \nsame  under  a  registered  sale  deed  on  12.3.1981.  The \nacquisition proceedings had been initiated for formation of \ninner  ring  road  and  consequently  26  cents  from  the \npetitioners  1  and  2  and  12  cents  from  another  person, \nnamely, Raja Peer Mohammed were acquired thereby leaving \nthe balance land in the hands of the petitioners. However, \n3\nafter  completion  of  the  acquisition  proceedings,  the \nRevenue Department wrongly classified the remaining land in \nthe  hands  of  the  petitioner  as  Government  Poromboke \nHighways land without any notice to the petitioners. Even \nin respect of the said remaining extent of land, further \nacquisition proceedings were initiated for the purpose of \nover bridge at Koyambedu junction. The petitioners were not \ngiven  any  notice  nor  their  names  appeared  in  the \nnotification. Since the said lands were wrongly classified \nas  Government  Poromboke  Highways  land,  the  present  writ \npetition is filed seeking for the prayer, as stated supra. \n3. After hearing the matter on several occasions, it \nwas  represented  before  this  Court  on  24.7.2013  by  the \nlearned  Special  Government  Pleader  that  the  District \nCollector,  Chennai,  had  already  completed  all  the \nformalities including recording of the statement from the \npetitioners  and  as  a  matter  of  fact,  the  proposal  for \nchange of classification is under process for being sent to \nthe  Commissioner  of  Land  Administration  for  change  of \nclassification. The learned Special Government Pleader also \nproduced the letter of the District Collector addressed to \nhim  dated  23.7.2013,  to  that  effect.  Thus,  the  learned \nSpecial  Government  Pleader  sought  for  15  days  time  to \n4\nreport the compliance of change of classification by the \nGovernment. Considering the said request, this Court has \nadjourned  the  matter  on  12.8.2013.  When  the  matter  was \ntaken  up  on  20.8.2013,  at  the  request  of  the  learned \nSpecial  Government  Pleader,  it  was  again  adjourned  on \n27.8.2013. \n4. Today, the matter is listed before me and even now, \nthe  respondents  had  not  complied  with  the  earlier \nundertaking given by them for changing the classification \nof  the  land.  However,  the  learned  Special  Government \nPleader seeks further time for reporting compliance. \n5. The grievance of the petitioner is that their land \nhas  been  wrongly  classified  as  Government  Poromboke \nHighways  land  and  the  same  was  subject  to  the  land \nacquisition proceedings without giving them compensation. \n6. The said fact is not disputed by the respondents \nand on the other hand, they admitted that it was wrongly \nclassified as Government Poromboke Highways land and for \nseeking reclassification of the same, they are taking steps \nto rectify the mistake.\n5\n7. It is seen from the proceedings of the District \nCollector of Chennai, dated 23.7.2013, which is a letter \naddressed to the Government Pleader of this Court, that the \nland had been wrongly registered as Sarkar Poramboke during \nthe process of town survey and the proposal for change of \nclassification has to be sent to the Commissioner of Land \nAdministration  and  the  same  is  being  under  process. \nFurther, the proceedings dated 6.8.2013 addressed by the \nCollector of Chennai addressed to the Principal Secretary & \nCommissioner  of  Land  Administration,  Chepauk,  Chennai, \nwould show that he has made request for ordering change of \nclassification of the subject matter land so as to enable \nthe competent authority and the Special District Revenue \nOfficer,  Land  Acquisition,  National  Highways  Kancheepuram \nand  Tiruvallur  District  to  proceed  further  to  pay  the \ncompensation to the first petitioner herein. \n8. Thus, from these proceedings, it is crystal clear \nthat the respondents are admitting that a mistake has crept \nin classifying the land. Further, they want to rectify the \nsame  by  addressing  the  competent  authority,  namely,  the \nPrincipal Secretary & Commissioner of Land Administration, \nChepauk,  Chennai.  When  that  being  the  admitted  factual \nposition, the matter cannot be adjourned again and again \n6\nfor reporting their compliance. Therefore, I feel, it would \nsuffice, if a suitable direction is issued to them in this \nwrit petition. Accordingly, the respondents are directed to \nreclassify  subject  matter  land  within  a  period  of  four \nweeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order and \nconsequent  upon  such  reclassification,  the  competent \nauthority  is  to  take  steps  to  disburse  the  compensation \namount  to  the  petitioners  within  a  period  of  six  weeks \nthereafter. Accordingly, the writ petition is disposed of. \nNo costs. Connected W.P.M.P.No.11638 of 2006 is closed.\n3.9.2013\nINDEX    : YES/NO\nINTERNET : YES/NO\nlan\nTo:\n1.

The petitioners' claim that they are french nationals \nand citizens and all  the members of  their  family are also french \nnationals of Indian origin.  It is their case that G.O.Ms.No.38 Home \nDepartment  dated  23.11.1998  came  to  be  passed  by  the  first \nrespondent Government whereby a Special Cell was constituted to \nevict  the  trespassers  from the  property  belonging  to  the  french \n3\ncitizens.   Based  on  the  said  G.O.,  the  petitioners  preferred  a \ncomplaint and no action was taken by the Special Cell for a long \ntime.  On the other hand, steps were taken to lay a road to enable \nthe  trespassers  to  have  free  access.   Hence,  the  petitioners \npreferred  W.P.No.4077  of  2000  to  forbear  the  authorities  from \nlaying the road.  The said writ petition was allowed on 11.04.2000 \nand this Court directed the Special Cell to consider the petitioners' \ncomplaint  and  pass  orders  as  expeditiously  as  possible.   On \n25.07.2000, the respondents 2 to 5 informed the petitioners to seek \nremedy  in  a  Civil  Court.  The  said  order  was  further  challenged \nbefore this Court by the petitioners in W.P.No.7629 of 2001 wherein \nan order came to be passed directing the Member Secretary, Special \nCell to consider and dispose of the request of the petitioners afresh \nin the light of G.O.Ms.No.38 Home Department dated 23.11.1998. \nConsequent upon such direction, the present impugned order came \nto  be  passed  on  27.01.2004,  wherein  the  fourth  respondent \ndirected the petitioners to take legal course of action by filing a civil \nsuit to legally evict the encroachers from the site and possession. \nChallenging the said order, the present writ petition is filed before \nthis court.  \n3.The  writ  petition  was  resisted  by  the  respondents  by \nfiling a counter affidavit. \n4.Heard both sides.\n4\n5.In  the  counter  affidavit  filed  on  behalf  of  the \nrespondents, it is stated that on enquiry conducted, it was found \nthat  the  land  in  question  stands  registered  in  the  name  of  the \npetitioners  and their  family member as per  the revenue records. \nHowever, there are 21 encroachers in the said land and they have \nput up dwelling huts/brick-houses with tiled/cement/asbestos roofs \nand  they stated  to  have  been  residing for  more  than  15  years, \nwithout any apparent objection from any quarter.  It is also stated \nthat they have obtained electricity connections for their house and \nthe area is further provided with basic civic  amenities like street \nlights, public water tap, etc.,\n6.It  is  the  case  of  the  respondents  that  they  have  no \npower  to  evict  the  encroachers  under  G.O.Ms.No.38,  Home \nDepartment  dated  23.11.1998,  whereby  the  Special  Cell  was \nconstituted  to  deal  only  with  the  land  grabbers.  Thus,  it  is \ncontended  by  the  respondents  that  the  remedy  available  to  the \npetitioners is only to file a civil suit against those encroachers and \nseek remedy before the Civil Court  in accordance with law.\n7.Ms.M.B.Dominique,  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioners \nsubmitted that the encroachment was made at the instance of the \nGovernment and therefore, these encroachers have to be removed \n5\nby the Government by exercising powers conferred on the Special \nCell by G.O.Ms.No.38 Home Department dated 23.11.1998. \n8. The said contention was stoutly resisted by the learned \ncounsel for the respondents.   Though the learned counsel for the \npetitioners  contends  that  the  encroachment  was  made  at  the \ninstance of the Government, she could not place any materials to \nsubstantiate such contention.  Whatever the claim may be, the fact \nremains  that  the  proceedings  issued  by  the  respondents  dated \n25.07.2000  in  pursuant  to  the  orders  issued  by  this  court  in \nW.P.No.4077  of  2000  dated  11.04.2000,  would  disclose  that  the \nrespondents have stated therein that there are 22 encroachers in \nthe land by putting up a dwelling house and residing there for more \nthan 15 years  without  any apparent  objection from any quarter. \nThat means, the encroachers are said to be in possession of the \nproperty even from they year 1985.  The said contention raised by \nthe respondents and its correctness or otherwise has to be gone \ninto only by civil  court by considering the evidence let in by the \nrespective parties.  \n9.According to the petitioners, the persons in occupation \nare the land grabbers.  On the other hand, it is the contention of the \nrespondents that those persons are there in the property for more \nthan 30 years as on date as encroachers and therefore, they cannot \n6\nbe termed as grabbers and they are only encroachers against whom \nthe petitioners have to seek remedy only by filing a civil  suit  in \naccordance  with  law.   Even  in  the  impugned  order  dated \n27.01.2004, it is admitted by the respondents that the petitioners' \nland has been encroached upon by 22 people and the petitioners \nhave  already  taken  legal  course  of  action  by  filing  a  civil  suit \nthrough proceedings dated 25.07.2000.  It is also to be noted at \nthis  juncture  that  this  court  while  disposing  of  the  earlier  writ \npetition  in  W.P.No.7629  of  2001  dated  23.01.2003,  has  only \nobserved  that  without  going  into  the  question  whether  the \nGovernment can exercise their power to evict those persons who \nhave  encroached  upon  the  private  property,  the  learned  Single \nJudge  has  only  directed  the  respondents  to  dispose   of  the \npetitioners'  request  in  the  light  of  the   G.O.Ms.No.38,  Home \nDepartment dated 23.11.1998.  Now, the respondents in pursuant \nto the said order of this court passed therein passed the present \nimpugned order  stating that they have no power under the said \nG.O., however by giving liberty to the petitioners to approach the \nCivil Court when it is contended that those persons are there in the \nproperty for more than 30 years.\n10.Therefore, in my considered view, the petitioners have \nto  only  file  a  Civil  suit  against  those  encroachers  and  seek \n7\nappropriate remedy before the Civil Court.  It is also to be noted \nthat those encroachers have not been made as parties in this writ \npetition.  At any event, as this Court finds that the petitioners have \nto approach the civil court, there is no necessity for directing the \npetitioners  to  implead  those  encroachers  as  parties  in  the  writ \npetition.  Consequently,  the  writ  petition is  disposed  of  by  giving \nliberty  to  the  petitioners  to  approach  the  Civil  Court  by  filing \nappropriate  Civil  Suit  against  those  encroachers  and  seek \nappropriate remedy therein.  Since this court is giving liberty to the \npetitioners  to  approach  the  Civil  Court  for  seeking  appropriate \nremedy, it is made clear that the Civil Court cannot reject the suit to \nbe filed by the petitioners on the ground of limitation.  In all other \naspects, the Civil Court shall consider the claim on merits and in \naccordance with law. With these observations, the writ petition is \ndisposed of.   No costs.   The connected miscellaneous  petition is \nclosed.\n  04.09.2013\nIndex    :Yes/No\nInternet :Yes/No\nvri\nK.RAVICHANDRABAABU,J.\n8\nVri\nTo\n1.Union of India,\n   The State of Pondicherry,\n   Rep.

The petitioner \n3\nafter  putting  more  than  20  years  of  service,  expressed  his \nwillingness to retire voluntarily.  His request was forwarded  by the \nBranch  Manager  through  his  letters  dated  21.06.1999  and \n08.07.1999  to  the  General  Manager  of  the  second  respondent \nCorporation.  Though it was originally rejected, the petitioner was \nsubsequently  permitted  to  retire  voluntarily  with  effect  from \n31.12.1999  through  the  communication  dated  16.12.1999.   The \nDeputy Manager also issued a Service Certificate dated 31.12.1999 \ncertifying  that  the  petitioner  was  in  service  from 16.03.1979  to \n31.12.1999.  Thereafter, the petitioner requested the respondent to \nsanction pension.  The said request was rejected by the impugned \norder on the ground that the petitioner did not complete 20 years of \nservice and also not attained the age of 50 years at the time of \nvoluntary retirement, by relying on Rule 16(a)(ii) of the Tamilnadu \nState  Transport  Corporation  Employees'  Pension  Fund  Rules. \nChallenging  the  said  order,  the  present  writ  petition  in \nW.P.No.14474 of 2002 is filed before this Court.\n4.No counter affidavit is filed by the respondents till this \ndate.   Mr.V.R.Kamalanathan,  learned  counsel  for  the  second \nrespondent  Corporation  however  now  seeks  time  to  file  counter \naffidavit.  I am not inclined to grant time for filing counter affidavit \nfor two reasons, firstly, that the writ petition came to be filed in the \n4\nyear 2002 and notice was ordered therein to the respondents and \neven after a period of 11 years, they have not chosen to file any \ncounter affidavit and only when the matter was taken up today for \nfinal  disposal,  they  seek  time  to  file  counter  affidavit  which  I \nconsider  as  an  unreasonable  request.   Secondly,  the  issue  that \narises for consideration in this writ petition is already covered by a \ndecision of the Division Bench of this Court made in Writ  Appeal \nmade in W.A.(MD)No.585 of 2007 dated 20.03.2008, wherein the \nHon'ble Division Bench rejected the similar objection raised by the \nTransport  Corporation  by  holding that  having accepted  voluntary \nretirement on the assumption that the employees had completed 20 \nyears of service, the Corporation cannot turn back and contend that \nbecause of non-completion of 20 years of service, the employee was \nnot eligible for pension.\n5.The relevant paragraphs of the abovesaid decision of the \nHon'ble Division Bench of this Court are extracted herein:\n\"3.The  present  first  respondent  was  initially \nappointed  as  a  Trainee  Driver  and  subsequently \nregularized in the service with effect from 01.07.1982. \nDuring the period as Trainee Driver, he had become a \nmember of the Employees'  Provident Fund Scheme on \n01.08.1981.  Subsequently, he had sought for voluntary \nretirement pursuant to a voluntary retirement scheme \nintroduced  by  the  Transport  Corporation  making  it \n5\navailable to persons who were above 50 years and had \ncompleted 20 years of service.  Under such scheme, the \npresent first respondent was allowed to retire voluntarily  \nfrom service with effect from 31.05.2003 obviously on \nthe  assumption  that  he  had  completed  20  years  of \nservice.\n4.In the meanwhile, the Pension Scheme had \nbeen made applicable to the Corporation Employees with \neffect from 01.09.1998.  After retirement, the present \nfirst  respondent  had  requested  the  Corporation  to \nforward his papers  to the Tamil  Nadu State Transport \nCorporation Employees Pension Fund Trust, Chennai-9. \nHowever,  under the impugned letters,  the Corporation \nrefused to forward all those papers for availing pension.  \nSubsequently, the present first respondent applied to the \nCorporation for payment of pension, but, the Corporation \ndenied such claim of the petitioner by issuing impugned \nletters,  wherein  it  was  indicated  that  he  had  not \ncompleted  20  years  of  service  and  he  had  only \ncompleted 19 years, 8 months and 27 days of service. \nThis calculation was made by deducting the period when \nthe applicant was on leave on loss of pay.\n5.In  the  writ  petition,  the  contention  of  the \npresent  first  respondent  was  accepted  by  the  learned \nSingle  Judge  by  referring  to  Rule  13(B)  of  the  Tamil \nNadu  State  Transport  Corporation  Employees'  Pension \nFunds Rules, whereunder, it is indicated that service can \nbe rounded  off to the nearest year.\n6.The contention of the learned counsel for the \nappellant that in fact, the provision relating to rounding \noff the year is applicable to the persons who entered into \n6\nservice  only  after  01.01.1998  and  it  may  not  be \napplicable to other existing employees.\n7.In the peculiar facts and circumstances of the \npresent case, we do not feel that it is necessary to delve \ninto this question, as, in our opinion, if the present first  \nrespondent had not completed 20 years of service, he \nwas not eligible for seeking voluntary retirement under \nthe scheme provided by the Transport Corporation and \ntherefore at that stage, the Transport Corporation should \nnot have accepted such voluntary retirement.   Having \naccepted such voluntary retirement on the assumption \nthat the employees had completed 20 years of service, \nnow  the  appellant  Corporation  cannot  turn  back  and \ncontend that because of non-completion of 20 years of  \nservice, the present first respondent was not eligible to \npension.  Therefore, in our considered opinion, the order  \npassed by the learned Single Judge does not require any \ninterference.\"\n6.The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  also  placed  a \ndecision of the Apex Court made in Special  Leave Petition (Civil) \nNo.16446/2013 dated 08.05.2013 arising out of the judgment made \nin Writ Appeal No.629 of 2012 dated 17.09.2012 by this Court. The \nHon'ble Supreme Court, after considering the matter, has observed \nthat once the application for voluntary retirement was accepted, the \nCorporation  and its  Officers  were  estopped from questioning the \nentitlement  of  the  employee  to  receive  the  pensionary  benefit. \nThus, by dismissing the S.L.P., the Apex Court has also imposed a \n7\ncost of Rs.1,00,000/- on the Managing Director of the Corporation. \nThe relevant paragraphs of the order of the Apex Court is extracted \nhereunder:\nRespondent No.1 challenged the denial of \npensionary benefits by filing a petition under Article \n226 of the Constitution.  The learned Single Judge \nreferred to the orders passed in other similar cases \nand  held  that  there  was  absolutely  no  reason  to \ndeny pensionary benefits  to respondent No.1.",

There are 170 members in the \nAssociation.\n2.  It  is  stated  that  for  the  benefit  of  the  members  of  the \nAssociation,  they  purchased  9 acres  of  land in  Survey  No.109,  No.32, \nKaranai  Village,  Chengalpet  Taluk,  Kancheepuram  District  by  an \nunregistered sale deed dated 26.12.1997 from one Arunachalam for a sale \nconsideration of Rs.3,47,000/- (Rupees Three lakhs forty seven thousand \nonly). The unregistered sale deed is enclosed in the typed set of papers.\n3.  In  the  unregistered  sale  deed  dated  26.12.1997  filed  by  the \npetitioner,  the land is described as Odai Poramboke. It is not clear as to \nhow the said Arunachalam has title over Odai Poramboke.  The petitioner \nhas  enclosed  a  recommendation  dated  31.08.2010  of  the  Revenue \nInspector, Kelambakkam recommending for assignment of the aforesaid \nland in favour of the petitioner.\n4. Based on the aforesaid recommendation, the petitioner has filed \nthis writ petition, seeking for a direction to respondents 1 to 3  to grant \nassignment of the said land in Kancheepuram District, Chengalpet Taluk \nNo.32,  Karnai Village S.No.109,  9 acres  of  land in favour of  petitioner \nAssociation and to forbear the 4th respondent from interfering with their \n3\npeaceful possession and enjoyment of the said property.\n5. The learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the 4th \nrespondent, the President of the Panchayat is objecting for the assignment \nof the said land.  It is submitted that the land has to be assigned to the \nAssociation as they have purchased the said land for providing house sites \nto its members.\n6. On the other hand, the learned Special Government Pleader has \nsubmitted  that  the  petitioner  cannot  seek  as  a  matter  of  right  for \nassignment of the land. The petitioner Association purchased the land at \ntheir own risk since their vendor Arunachalam has no title to sell Odai \nPoramboke.  The learned Special  Government  Pleader has  further \nsubmitted that only if there is a statutory right, the petitioner can ask for \nenforcement  of  the  same  as  held  by  the  Division  of  this  Court  in \nM.Solaikannan  v.  The  Cabinet  Secretary  to  the  Union  Cabinet, \nUnion Secretariat, New Delhi reported in 2013 (1) CWC 569. \n7. Paragraph 22 of the said judgment may be usefully extracted \nbelow:-\n\"22. In the considered opinion of this Court, unless the \nPetitioner establishes that he is having a specific legal \nright and the Respondents are also under the statutory \nobligation to carry out their duties and in the event of \ntheir  failure  to  do  so,  Mandamus  may be  issued  to \ncompel to do something.\"\n8. Heard both sides.\n4\n9. As per the unregistered sale deed enclosed in the typed set of \npapers, the land measuring 9 acres is described as Odai Poramboke.  It \nwas said to have been purchased from one Arunachalam.  Based on the \nsale  deed,  the petitioner  approached the  Village Administrative Officer, \nKelambakkam village and he recommended for assignment of  the land \nstating that it  is  not  a water body. The same is also endorsed by the \nRevenue Inspector vide proceedings in O.Mu.536 dated 31.08.2010.\n10. It is not clear as to how the Village Administrative Officer and \nRevenue Inspector can issue such letters recommending  assignment of \nOdai Poramboke stating that there is no water body in the said land.  As \nrightly stated by the learned Special Government Pleader, the petitioner \nhas no statutory right to seek for assignment of the land. The petitioner \nhas not cited any provision seeking for such assignment.\n11.  There  is  no  merit  in  the  writ  petition.  Accordingly,  the  writ \npetition stands dismissed.  A direction is issued to the first respondent to \ntake  appropriate  action  against  the  concerned  Village  Administrative \nOfficer and Revenue Inspector, who recommended for assignment of Odai \nPoramboke.

But as \nper law, framing of charge against accused is the function of the Court. \n3\n9.Under Section 173 Cr.P.C.,  the report  submitted by the Investigating \nOfficer is \"Police Report\" [See Section 2(r) Cr.P.C.]. It is also known as Final Report. \nIt does not always mean a positive report, namely, 'offences appears to have been \ncommitted'.  It may be positive or negative. If  it  is positive, it is called as \"charge \nsheet\". If it is negative, it is called \"referred charge sheet\". But these words are not \nemployed in the Code. \n10.As per the instructions in the Police Standing Order,  such negative \nreport  (referred charge sheet)  has to be informed to  the defacto complainant  by \nissuing a police notice (R.C.S. notice) and thereafter only such negative report has \nto be filed before the Court. So final report does not always mean charge sheet. An \nF.I.R. may be referred as \"mistake of fact\", \"mistake of law\", \"Accidental fire\", \"a civil \ncase\", etc. Then it is negative report. But, it is also a (police) report.\n11.Once FIR is registered under Section 154 Cr.P.C., every step in the \ninvestigation has to be reported to the jurisdiction Magistrate, who has monitoring \nrole over the Investigating officer during investigation, but the Magistrate cannot and \nshould not direct the manner or method of investigation. Court cannot take the role \nof Investigating Officer. After the registration of the FIR, it is the bounden duty of the \nInvestigating  Officer  to  report  to  the  Court  as  to  his  investigation,  whether  it  is \nnegative or positive. It is the duty of the Magistrate to pass orders thereon.\n12.Once a report, whether positive or negative is filed, few courses are \nopened  to  the  Magistrate.  If  it  is  a  \"positive  report\",  the  Magistrate  has to  take \ncognizance of the offences mentioned therein [See Section 190 Cr.P.C.]. If it is a \n\"negative  report\",  certain  courses  are  opened  to  the  Magistrate.  Either  the \nMagistrate accept such a conclusion of the Investigating Officer or he can come to a \ndifferent conclusion, if there are positive materials and he can take the case on file, \n4\nin other words, he can take cognizance. If the Magistrate finds some loose ends or \nneed  clarification,  he  can direct  the  investigating officer  accordingly.  But,  before \naccepting the negative report, that is to say \"police version\", notice shall be issued \nto the defacto complainant, who had set the criminal law in motion. The Magistrate \nmust consider the objection of the defacto complainant. It is called \"protest petition\" \nSuch petition shall take the character of a private complaint. The Magistrate then \nfollow the procedure accordingly. \n13.Once  RCS notice  is  issued,  police  may wash their  hands.  But  the \nMagistrate cannot. The Magistrate has to discharge his judicial function under the \nCode. Police has been given the power of  enforcement.  But,  the Magistrate has \nbeen  given  the  power  of  administration  of  criminal  justice.  It  is  the  duty  of  the \nMagistrate to do justice according to law. But, at the same time, he cannot function \nlike a Prosecutor or a defence counsel. He must be an umpire between both. But he \nshall not be a passive onlooker. He must play a positive role under Code.\n14.In this view of the matter, on the final report filed by the police after \nserving RCS notice on the defacto complainant,  i.e.,  Hemavathy, the learned VII \nMetropolitan Magistrate, George Town will take further action in accordance with law \nand the guidance given in this order. \n15.With the above direction, this criminal original petition is disposed of. \n   02.09.2013\nIndex : Yes\nInternet : Yes\nvvk\nTo\n5\n1.The Inspector of Police,\n   B-2, Esplanade Police Station,\n   Esplanade,\n   Chennai-600 104.\n2.The Public Prosecutor,\n   High Court,\n   Madras.\nP.DEVADASS, J.\n vvk\n6\nCrl.O.P.No.19520 of 2013\n  02.09.2013\n",

Respondents\nPetition filed under Article 226 of the Constitution of India for the \nissuance  of  writ  of  Mandamus  calling  for  the  records  of  the  1st \nrespondent in Na.Ka.No.3004-09 A2. Review Petition No.2/09 A2 dated \n10.9.09  and  the  order  of  the  1st  respondent  in   Revision  Petition \nNa.Ka.4580/08 A2  Revision Petition No.19/08 dated 24.9.08 and the \norder of the 2nd respondent dated 14.3.08 and quash the said orders \nand direct the respondents to reinstate the petitioner in service with all \nattendant benefits and continuity of service.\nFor Petitioner     :  Mr.Balan Haridas for\n     Mr.P.Krishnan\nFor Respondent-1 :  Mr.L.P.Shanmuga Sundaram, Spl.G.P\n2\nO R D E R\nThe petitioner was a Clerk in the second  respondent Cooperative \nBank.  He was also given additional charge as Secretary.  While so, an \norder dated 23.1.2007 was passed relieving him from the additional \nresponsibility  as  Secretary.   He  was  relieved  by  bringing  another \nperson from a different Society.\n2. The petitioner filed Writ Petition  No.6712 of 2007 against the \naforesaid  order  dated  23.1.2007.   This  Court  granted  stay  of  the \naforesaid order  on 26.2.2007.   Ultimately,  Writ  Petition No.6712 of \n2007  was  allowed  on  13.4.2007  on  the  ground  that  the  second \nrespondent has no jurisdiction to induct  an employee  from another \nCooperative  Society.   The matter  was remanded back to appoint  a \nSecretary in accordance with law.\n3. While so, the petitioner was placed under suspension by an \norder dated 14.3.2007 contemplating disciplinary action. \n4. He was issued with a charge memo dated 9.4.2007 making \nfive charges.  I am not inclined to go into the details of the charges in \nview of the order that is going to be passed hereunder.\n3\n5.  The  petitioner  gave  explanation  denying  the  charges. \nThereafter, an enquiry was held by a retired Cooperative Sub Registrar \non 5.10.2007.   Based on the enquiry,  the petitioner was dismissed \nfrom service by an order dated 14.3.2008.  The petitioner filed revision \npetition No.19/08/A2 under Section 153 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative \nSocieties Act  to the first  respondent against the aforesaid dismissal. \nAfter  hearing  both  sides,  the  first   respondent  revisional  authority \nrejected the revision petition by an order dated 24.9.2008.\n6.  The  petitioner  filed  a  Review  Petition  before  the  first \nrespondent under Section 154 of the Tamil Nadu Cooperative Societies \nAct.  The review petition was dismissed by an order dated 10.9.2009.\n7.  The  petitioner  has  filed  this  Writ  Petition  to  quash  the \naforesaid  orders  dated  24.9.2008  and  10.9.2009,  confirming  the \ndismissal  order  dated  14.3.2008,  dismissing  the  petitioner  from \nservice.\n8. Apart from raising various grounds, the petitioner has raised \nthe  grounds that the enquiry was not conducted in accordance with \nthe principles of natural justice, no documents were marked and he \nwas not given opportunity to cross-examine the witness.\n4\n9.  The  respondents  have  filed  counter  affidavit  refuting  the \nallegations.\n10. Heard both sides.\n11. The learned counsel for the petitioner has taken me through \nthe enquiry proceedings that took place on 5.10.2007. He submitted \nthat on 5.10.2007,  at  the very  commencement of  the enquiry,  the \npetitioner was asked to make a statement in the enquiry. Thereafter, a \nstatement  was  recorded  from  the  Secretary  of  the  Society. \nThereafter, the enquiry was closed. According to him, examining the \ndelinquent before examining the witness of the society (management \nor department) is violative of principles of natural justice.  Since the \nburden is on the management or Department to prove the allegations, \nthe Department shall first examine their witness and thereafter  the \nturn of the delinquent would come for rebuttal evidence.\n12.  Further,  it  is  submitted that  the petitioner  was not given \nopportunity to cross-examine the witness. After simply recording the \nstatement  of  the  Secretary,  the  enquiry  was  closed.   It  is  also \nsubmitted that no documents were marked in the enquiry.  He has \nsubmitted that  minimum ingredients of valid enquiry are not present \n5\nin this case.  \n13. The learned counsel for the petitioner has heavily relied on \nthe judgment of the Apex Court in State of Uttaranchal and others \nvs.  Kharak  Singh  reported  in  (2008)  8  SCC  236.,  and  more \nparticularly paragraph 15(iii) and it is extracted hereunder:\n\"(iii)  In an enquiry, the employer/department should take \nsteps  first  to  lead  evidence  against  the \nworkman/delinquent charged and give an opportunity to \nhim to cross-examine the witnesses of the employer.  Only \nthereafter, the workman/delinquent be asked whether he \nwants  to  lead  any  evidence  and  asked  to  give  any \nexplanation about the evidence led against him.\"\n14. On the other hand, the  learned counsel for the Society has \nvehemently contended that the petitioner was given opportunity and \nhe could not  complain at  this  point  of  time that  he was not given \nopportunity.\n15.  I  have  considered  the  submissions  made  by  the  learned \ncounsel  on either side and I have perused the enquiry proceedings \ndated 5.10.2007.\n16.   As  rightly  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \npetitioner, the statement of the petitioner was recorded at the very \ncommencement of the enquiry proceedings on 5.10.2007 itself.  The \nstatement of the petitioner runs to first four pages.  Thereafter, the \n6\nstatement of the Secretary of the Society was recorded and that runs \nto 3 pages.  After  recording the statement of  the Secretary of  the \nSociety,   the  enquiry  was  closed.   This  procedure  adopted  by  the \nenquiry officer is questioned by the learned counsel for the petitioner.\n17.  As  rightly  contended  by  the  learned  counsel  for  the \npetitioner,  no  documents  were  marked  in  the  enquiry,  particularly, \nsome of the charges have to be established by marking the relevant \ndocuments.    Further  more,  the  petitioner  was  not  also  given \nopportunity  to  cross-examine  the  witness  and  the  enquiry  was \ncompleted on the same day on 5.10.2007 in the aforesaid fashion.\n18. The Apex Court in the decision cited supra has laid down the \nguidelines  about  the  minimum  ingredients  of  a  valid  enquiry. \nParagraph 15 of the said judgment is extracted hereunder:\n\"15.  From the  above  decisions,  the  following  principles \nwould emerge:\n (i) The enquiries must be conducted bona fide and \ncare  must  be  taken  to  see  that  the  enquiries  do  not \nbecome empty formalities.\n(ii) If an officer is a witness to any of the incidents  \nwhich  is  the  subject-matter  of  the  enquiry  or  if  the \nenquiry was initiated on a report of an officer, then in all  \nfairness he should not be the enquiry officer.  If the said \n7\nposition  becomes  known  after  the  appointment  of  the \nenquiry officer, during the enquiry, steps should be taken \nto see that the task of holding an enquiry is assigned to  \nsome other officer.\n(iii)In an enquiry, the employer/department should \ntake  steps  first  to  lead  evidence  against  the \nworkman/delinquent charged and give an opportunity to \nhim  to  cross-examine  the  witnesses  of  the  employer. \nOnly  thereafter,  the  workman/delinquent  be  asked \nwhether he wants to lead any evidence and asked to give \nany explanation about the evidence led against him.\n(iv)On  receipt  of  the  enquiry  report,  before \nproceeding  further,  it  is  incumbent  on  the  part  of  the \ndisciplinary/punishing authority  to  supply a  copy of  the \nenquiry report  and all  connected materials relied on by \nthe  enquiry  officer  to  enable  him to  offer  his  views,  if  \nany.\"\nIt is made clear in paragraph 15(iii) of the above judgment that the \nDepartment shall examine its witness first before giving opportunity to \nthe delinquent to let in evidence.   It is well established principle of \nlaw, whether in departmental enquiry or civil proceedings or criminal \nproceedings, that the person who makes allegations shall prove the \nsame after examining the witness first.  The same is not followed in \nthe present case.\n19. Further, the petitioner has produced another judgment of the \nSupreme Court in  Roop Singh Negi vs. Punjab Natinal Bank and \nothers reported in (2009) 2 SCC 570    for proposition that mere \nproduction of documents is not sufficient and the same shall be proved \n8\nby  marking  those  documents  and  the  petitioner  shall  be  given \nopportunity to cross-examine thereon.  Paragraph 14 of the aforesaid \njudgment  is extracted hereunder:\n\"14.  Indisputably,  a departmental proceeding is a quasi-\njudicial proceeding.  The enquiry officer performs a quasi-\njudicial  function.   The  charges  levelled  against  the \ndelinquent  officer  must  be  found  to  have  been  proved. \nThe enquiry officer has a duty to arrive at a finding upon \ntaking into consideration the materials brought on record \nby the parties.  The purported evidence collected during \ninvestigation  by  the  investigating  officer  against  all  the \naccused by itself could not be treated to be evidence in the \ndisciplinary  proceeding.   No  witness  was  examined  to \nprove the said documents.   The management witnesses \nmerely tendered the documents and did not prove  the \ncontents thereof.  Reliance, inter alia, was placed by the \nenquiry  officer  on  the  IR  which  could  not  have  been \ntreated as evidence.",

During the pendency of the writ petition, an amendment petition in \nM.P.No.1 of 2013 has been filed seeking to amend the prayer in the writ petition, \nnamely, to quash the impugned seniority list of Secondary Grade Teacher dated \n1.1.2009 issued by the third respondent with a consequential direction to re-fix \nthe petitioner's  seniority  taking into account  the petitioner's  length of  service \nwhich he had rendered at Pappireddipatti  Panchayat Union from 13.6.90 and \ngive notional  promotion to the petitioner  as Primary School  Headmaster  with \neffect  from the  date on which his  juniors  were promoted as  Primary  School \nHeadmaster and pay all the monetary benefits to him.\n3.  Heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  and  the  learned \nAdditional Government Pleader for the respondents 1 to 3. \n3\n4.  Considering  the  prayer  in  the  amendment  petition  filed  by  the \npetitioner,  when this Court looks at the earlier  order passed by this  Court in \nW.P.No.10342 of 2005 dated 5.2.2008, the present prayer cannot be ordered. \nThe reason being that when the petitioner already came to this Court challenging \nthe third respondent's seniority list dated 1.1.2004 of Primary School Headmaster \nin Harur Panchayat Union, as it related to non-inclusion of the petitioner's name \nin  the  seniority  list,  and  consequently  to  promote  him  as  Primary  School \nHeadmaster with retrospective effect  from 28.6.99 with all  consequential  and \nmonetary benefits, this Court, in paragraph-5, finding against him that there was \nno merit in his prayer, rejected the same. When the petitioner's earlier request \nto  give  him  promotion  with  effect  from  28.6.99  with  all  consequential  and \nmonetary  benefits  was  already  rejected  by  order  dated  5.2.2008  in \nW.P.No.10342  of  2005,  which  was  also  affirmed  by  a  Division  Bench  in \nW.A.No.306 of 2009 by order dated 6.9.2010, it is not known how the present \namendment petition in M.P.No.1 of 2013 has been moved seeking to promote \nhim from the year 1990.  When the earlier challenge of the petitioner for giving \nhim promotion with effect from 28.6.99 was already rejected, the petitioner is \nasking  a  prayer  which  cannot  be  countenanced  viz.,  to  give  him  notional \npromotion from the year 1990. Therefore, the amendment petition is dismissed. \nIn the light of the said order, the writ petition is liable to be dismissed. Secondly, \nthe  petitioner,  who  was  appointed  as  Secondary  Grade  Teacher  in  Harur \nPanchayat  Union  and joined  duty  in  the  said  post  on  11.8.86,  subsequently \napplied for transfer on his own request to go to Pappireddipatti Panchayat Union \n4\nand joined duty there on 13.6.90.  After ten years, the petitioner made another \nrequest to go back to Harur Panchayat Union from Pappireddipatti  Panchayat \nUnion.   The  Assistant  Elementary  Educational  Officer,  Pappireddipatti,  by  his \nproceedings  in  Na.Ka.No.1870/A/2000  dated  8.11.2000,  in  page-33  of  the \nservice register of the petitioner, has clearly recorded that the petitioner asked \nfor  transfer  from Pappireddipatti  Panchayat  Union  to Harur  Panchayat  Union. \nAccepting the request transfer, he was posted back to Harur Panchayat Union. \nSubsequently, he joined duty at Harur Panchayat Union on 9.11.2000.  While so, \nthe prayer of the petitioner to count his service from 13.6.90 cannot be ordered. \nThe reason being that when a Government employee makes a request transfer \nfrom one place to another, he has to be placed in the bottom of the list to which \nhe  has  been  transferred  on  his  own  request.   In  view  of  this  settled  legal \nposition, when the petitioner was transferred by the third respondent on his own \nrequest on 8.11.2000 to Harur Panchayat Union, he was placed as junior most \nteacher in Harur Panchayat Union. Therefore, when he was placed as junior most \nSecondary Grade Teacher  in  the seniority  list  maintained in  Harur  Panchayat \nUnion, he cannot claim seniority as on 11.8.86 i.e., from his initial appointment in \nHarur Panchayat Union.  For this reason also, the writ petition fails and the same \nis  dismissed.  Consequently,  M.P.Nos.1  and 2  of  2009  are also dismissed.

Petitioner\nVs\nThe State\nrep. by Inspector of Police,\nSulur Police Station,\nCoimbatore District.                                               ...     Respondents\nPrayer: Petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to \ncall  for  the  records  pertaining  to  the  order  dated  22.04.2013  made  in \nC.M.P.No.33 of 2013 in S.C.No.66 of 2011 on the file of the First Additional \nDistrict and Sessions Court, Coimbatore and set aside the same.   \nFor Petitioner     :  Mr.N.Manoharan \nFor Respondents : Mr.C.Emalias\n                                                         Addl. Public Prosecutor  \n  ORDER\nAggrieved by the order of the learned I Additional Sessions Judge, \nCoimbatore, in dismissing his petition in C.M.P.No.33 of 2013 under Section \n311 Cr.P.C., to recall the prosecution witnesses for cross-examination, the \naccused in SC.No.66 of  2011 has come forward with this  petition under \nSection 482 Cr.P.C. \n2\n2.  The sole accused is being prosecuted in S.C.No.66 of 2011, for \nhaving alleged to have committed murder for gain.  He is facing serious \ncharges for offences under Section 451, 392, 302, 201 r/w 302 IPC.  Thus, \nit includes capital charges also. Minimum is life imprisonment and maximum \nis taking away his life itself. \n3. Trial started. Prosecution produced its witnesses. The accused \nhimself cross examined the witnesses. He was not defended by a legally \ntrained person. Later, he has engaged a lawyer to defend him.  By the time, \nmany witnesses  were  examined.  The  Investigation  officer  also  has  been \nexamined in chief.\n4. At this juncture, the newly engaged defence counsel  rightly \napplied for recalling the witnesses filing C.M.P.No.33 of 2013 under Section \n311 Cr.P.C. to cross exam them.  Subsequently, memo was filed restricting \nthe number of witnesses to be recalled.  Ultimately, by his impugned order \ndated 22.4.2013, the learned I Additional Sessions Judge, ordered recalling \nof only P.Ws.5 and 17.\n5.  Aggrieved, the accused is before us.  \n3\n6.   A  reading  of  the  impugned  order  shows  that  the  learned \nAdditional Sessions Judge was under the impression that recalling of all the \nwitnesses would amount to retrial and thus it is impermissible. \n7.   The  learned  counsel  for  the  petitioner  submitted  that  the \npetitioner could not engage a counsel  to cross examine the witnesses, now, \nhe has engaged an Advocate to defend him, an opportunity is sought for to \ntest the veracity of the deposition of the prosecution witnesses.  The trial \nCourt has neither appreciated the scope of section 311 Cr.PC. nor applied \nsettled principles of law  and thus the defence is greatly prejudiced.  \n8.  The  learned  Additional  Public  Prosecutor  submitted that  the \nattempt of the accused to protract the trial has been rightly scuttled by the \ntrial Court.\n \n9.  Section 311 Cr.P.C.  gives opportunity to the defence/accused \nas well as to the State/prosecution to bring to the Court the evidence  which \nis very essential to render a just decision.  It could be resorted to at any \nstage  of  the  case,  however,  before  pronouncing  the  judgment.   It  is  a \ndimension of principles of natural justice, namely, 'hear before condemn'. \nThe 'hearing' will be 'mere formality' if reasonable opportunity is not given. \n4\n10.   The  basic  principle  of  English  criminal  law,  namely,  the \nallegations/charges levelled against the accused must be proved beyond all \nreasonable doubts has been imported to Indian Criminal Law.  Even now, \nthis is the position of law in India except certain statutory tinkering, for \ninstance,  offences  under  Section  306,  304-B  IPC.  Thus,  every  one  is \npresumed to be innocent till the guilt alleged is proved.  It is said that 'one's \npresumption of innocence itself is his basic human right'.\n11.  This is the position during pre and also post constitutional \nera.  It flows from Article 21, Constitution of India, which guarantees 'life' \nand 'personal liberty' to every one.  They can be taken away 'only' by a \n'procedure'  established  by  law.   The  procedure  must  be  'fair  and \nreasonable'. Thus, when there are provisions affecting or taking away one's \npersonal freedom, the procedure must have statutory birth and it must be \nfair and also reasonable.[See Maneka Gandhi Vs. Union of India (1978(1) \nSCC 248)].\n12.  As per Article 22(1) Constitution of India, persons accused of \nhaving  committed  offences  are  entitled  to  be  defended  by  a  legal \npractitioner of their choice.  It is an extension of principles of natural justice, \nnamely,  'hear  before  condemn'.  This  has  been  further  strengthened  by \nSections 303 and 304, Criminal Procedure Code, 1973.  Section 303 Cr.P.C. \n5\nreiterates the constitutional mandate enshrined in Article 22(1). Article 39-\nA, Constitution of India provides for providing legal aid to needy persons. \nSection 304 Cr.P.C directs the State to engage lawyer at its cost to defend a \nperson accused of having committed sessions offences.  It is a matter of \n'access to justice'.\n13.  Thus it follows that it is the right of  accused persons more \nparticularly who have been accused of having committed serious offences. \nHowever heinous the crime may be, however wicked the accused may be, \nhe is entitled to be defend by a lawyer of his choice.  It is his constitutional \nright. If a person, who is prosecuted  for capital charges, is not defended by \na lawyer, a legally trained person, any amount of opportunity given to him \nwill be illusory as 'hearing an accused without the assistance of a lawyer is \nlike hearing a deaf and dumb  person'.  \n14.   In  this  case,  foolishly,  the  petitioner/accused  himself  has \ncross  examined  the  prosecution  witnesses.   He  is  not  informed  of  his \nentitlement to be defend by a lawyer of his choice at State's cost nor a \nlegal aid panel lawyer has been engaged to defend him.  \n \n15.  In  HOFFMAN  ANDREAS  V.  INSPECTOR  OF \nCUSTOMS, AMRITSAR (2000 (10) SCC 430), emphasising grant of \n6\nfairest opportunity to the accused to prove his innocence is the object \nof every 'fair trial',  the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:-\n“In  such  circumstances,  if  the  new  Counsel \nthought to have the material  witnesses further \nexamined, the Court could adopt latitude and a \nliberal view in the interest of justice, particularly \nwhen  the  Court  has  unbridled  powers  in  the \nmatter as enshrined in Section 311 of the Code. \nAfter all the trial is basically for the prisoners and \ncourts should afford the opportunity to them in \nthe fairest manner possible.”\n16.  Thus,  in  P.SANJEEVA RAO Vs.  STATE [2012 (3) MWN \n(Crl.) 49 (SC)], it is held that \"it is trite that the credibility of  witnesses \nwhether  in  a  civil  or  criminal  case  can  be  tested  only  when  the \ntestimony is put through the fire of cross-examination. Denial of an \nopportunity to do so will result in a serious miscarriage of justice\". \n17.  In  NATASHA SINGH VS. CBI (2013(5) SCC 741), \nemphasising the observance of Human Right of accused persons in \nconducting trial, the Hon'ble Apex Court observed as under:-\n\"Fair  trial  is  the  main  object  of  criminal \nprocedure, and it is the duty of the court to ensure \nthat such fairness is not hampered or threatened in \n7\nany manner.  Fair  trial  entails  the  interests  of  the \naccused,  the  victim  and  of  the  society,  and \ntherefore,  fair  trial  includes  the  grant  of  fair  and \nproper opportunities to the person concerned, and \nthe  same  must  be  ensured  as  this  is  a \nconstitutional, as well as a human right. Thus, under \nno circumstances can a person’s right to fair trial be \njeopardized.  Adducing  evidence  in  support  of  the \ndefence  is  a  valuable  right.  Denial  of  such  right \nwould amount to the denial of a fair trial. Thus, it is \nessential that the rules of procedure that have been \ndesigned  to  ensure  justice  are  scrupulously \nfollowed, and the court must be zealous in ensuring \nthat  there  is  no breach of  the same.",

Respondents\nPrayer: Petition filed under Section 482 of the Criminal Procedure Code to \ncall for the entire records in C.C.No.70 of 2013 on the file of the Judicial \nMagistrate No.1, Vellore and quash the same. \n          For Petitioner     :  Mr.M.Radhakrishnan \n          ForRespondents : Mr.S.Shanmuga Velayutham, Senior Counsel\n                                      Public Prosecutor.\n \n  ORDER\nThe sole accused in C.C.No.70 of 2013 pending on the file of the \nlearned  Judicial  Magistrate  No.I,  Vellore  came  forward  to  quash  the \nproceedings in the said calendar case.\n2\n2.Originally, in C.C.No.1 of 1992,  petitioner Nalini, was awarded \ndeath sentence. Later, it was commuted to life. Now, the petitioner, as lifer, \nis lodged in the Special Prison for Women, Vellore. \n3.On 20.4.2010, it is alleged that when her cell was searched by \nPrison Officials, she was found to have a Cell-phone in a bag. When the \nOfficials tried to seize it, she deterred them from discharging their public \nduties and also screened the offence committed.\n4.On the same day, the Jail Superintendent conducted enquiry, \nexamined  witnesses  and  recorded  their  statement.  On  the  next  day, \nnamely, on 21.4.2010, the Superintendent also made a complaint to the \nInspector of Police, Bagayam Police Station, Vellore. Based on that, a case \nin Crime No.231 of 2010 was registered for offences under Sections 353, \n186 and 201 IPC read with Section 42 of the Prison Act, 1894. \n5.Ultimately,  in  the  enquiry  conducted  by  the  Jail \nSuperintendent, under Rule 302 (b)(7), the petitioner was awarded the \nmajor  punishment  of  permanent  reduction  from  higher  class  to  lower \nclass, namely, from 'A' Class to 'B' Class. \n6.In the meanwhile, in Crime No.231 of 2010, investigation was \ncompleted, final report was filed for offences under Sections 353, 186 and \n201 IPC read with Section 42 of the Prison Act, 1894. The learned Judicial \nMagistrate took cognizance thereon. Copies under Section 207 Cr.P.C were \n3\nfurnished to the petitioner. Charges were framed. Trial commenced. Some \nprosecution witnesses were also examined. \n7.At this juncture, the accused came forward to quash the entire \nproceedings in the said case. \n8.Mr.M.Radhakrishnan, learned counsel for the petitioner would \ncontend that when commission of prison offences and offences under the \nIndian Penal Code have been complained of, as per Rule 301 of the Tamil \nNadu Prison Rules, 1983, the Jail Superintendent has the option of either \nexercising her power  of  punishment conferred on her under the Prison \nRules or prosecuting the prisoner before the Magistrate. Since in this case, \nthe  Superintendent  has  already  exercised  her  power  of  punishment, \nthereafter,  she  has  no  jurisdiction  to  proceed  further  before  another \nforum. Thus, the criminal proceedings instituted and pending before the \nlearned Judicial Magistrate No.I, Vellore in C.C.No.70 of 2013 is without \njurisdiction.\n9.In support of his submission, the learned counsel referred to \nSections 42 and 45 of the Prisons Act, 1894, State Prison Rules and the \ndecision  of  the  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in  STATE  OF  HARYANA VS. \nGHASEETA RAM [1997 (3) SCC 766].\n10.On  the  other  hand,  the  learned  Public  Prosecutor  would \nsubmit that the petitioner, having committed distinct IPC offences, is being \nprosecuted for those offences before a competent judicial forum. Further, \n4\nthe punishment of permanent reduction from 'A' class to 'B' class awarded \nto her on 28.5.2010 has been set aside by a Division Bench of this court \non  15.3.2012  in  H.C.P.No.1357  of  2011  filed  by  the  petitioner  herself. \nConsequently, the entire proceedings of the Jail Superintendent, in which \nthe prisoner was imposed punishment was terminated. Thus, there was no \npunishment for the offences committed by her. Further, the calendar case \npending  before  the  learned  Magistrate  has  gone  a  long  way,  namely, \nexamination  of  witnesses.  Further,  on  facts,  the  decision  cited  is \ndistinguishable. Thus, quashing of the criminal proceedings will not arise.\n11.In reply,  Mr.Radhakrishnan would submit  that  the focus of \nthe petitioner's case is on the infraction of Rule 301 of the Tamil Nadu \nPrison Rules, 1983. It goes to the root of the matter. It shakes the very \njurisdiction of the learned Magistrate. In such circumstances, the petitioner \nhas no other alternative remedy to halt the illegality except invoking the \nextraordinary jurisdiction of this court under Section 482 Cr.P.C. Practically \nspeaking, it is not that the petitioner had not suffered any punishment. \nFrom  28.5.2010  to  15.3.2012,  she  suffered  the  major  punishment  of \npermanent reduction from 'A' Class to 'B' Class. What is important in a \ncase-law is not the facts,  what it decides, the principles and the point of \nlaw laid down therein.\n5\n12. I have anxiously considered the rival submissions, perused \nthe materials on record, relevant provisions of  the Prisons Act  and the \nState Jail Rules and the decision cited at the Bar.\n13.To  appreciate  the  contentions  of  either  side,  it  would  be \nprofitable to note and examine certain provisions of the Prisons Act, 1894 \nand the Tamil Nadu Prison Rules, 1983.\n14.Section 42 of the Prisons Act, 1894 runs as under :\n\"42.Penalty for introduction or removal of prohibited \narticles into or from prison and communication with \nprisoners. – Whoever, contrary to any rule under Sec.59 \nintroduces or removes or attempts by any means whatever \nto introduce or remove, into or from any prison, or supplies \nor attempts to supply to any prisoner, outside the limits of \na prison any prohibited article, \nand every officer of a prison who, contrary to any \nsuch  rule,  knowingly  suffers  any  such  article  to  be \nintroduced  into  or  removed  from  any  prison,  to  be \npossessed  by  any  prisoner,  or  to  be  supplied  to  any \nprisoner outside the limits of a prison, \nand  whoever,  contrary  to  any  such  rule, \ncommunicates  or  attempts  to  communicate  with  any \nprisoner, \nand whoever abets any offence made punishable \nby this section, shall, on conviction before a Magistrate, be \nliable  to  imprisonment  for  a  term  not  exceeding  six \nmonths, or to fine not exceeding two hundred rupees, or to \nboth.\n6\n15.The next connected provision is Section 45. We shall see the \nsame with sub clauses relevant for our purpose :\n\"45.Prison  Offences.-The  following  acts  are \ndeclared  to  be  prison  offences  when  committed  by  a \nprisoner.\n(1)such wilful disobedience to any regulation of \nthe  prison  as  shall  have  been  declared  by  rules  made \nunder Sec.59 to be a prison offence;\n(2)any assault or use of criminal force;\n(3) to (11) omitted\n(12)receiving,  possessing  or  transferring  any \nprohibited article;\n(13) and (14) omitted\n(15)Omitting or refusing to report, as soon as it \ncomes to his knowledge, the occurrence of any fire, any \nplot or conspiracy, any escape, attempt or preparation to \nescape, and any attack or preparation for attack upon any \nprisoner or prison official; and\n(16) omitted.\n16.Under Section 46, for the commission of prison offences, the \nJail  Superintendent  has  been  empowered  to  impose  various  kinds  of \npunishments on the prisoners subject to the restrictions in Sections 47 to \n50 of Prisons Act, 1894. \n7\n17.As  per  Section  52,  in  case  of  seriousness  of  the  prison \noffences  committed,  if  the  Jail  Superintendent  is  of  the  view that  the \nprisoner has to be severely punished, then he can forward the prisoner to \nthe  jurisdiction  Magistrate  to  impose  higher  punishment.  Section  52 \nemphasises  that  once  the  prisoner  has  been  punished  by  the \nSuperintendent,  exercising her  power  under  the  Prisons  Act,  again the \nprisoner cannot be prosecuted and punished before a Magistrate. Section \n52 incorporates the rule against double jeopardy.\n18.Rule  297  of  the  Tamil  Nadu  Prison  Rules,  1983 has  been \nframed to spelt out prison offences. We shall note it with the sub clauses \nrelevant for our purpose :\n297.Acts  declared  to  be  prison  offence \nunder section 45 of the Prisons Act, 1894 (Central \nAct IX of 1894).- The following acts are forbidden and \nevery prisoner who wilfully commits any of the following \nacts  shall  be  deemed  to  have  wilfully  disobeyed  the \nregulations of the prison, and to have committed a prison \noffence within the meaning of section 45 of the Prisons Act, \n1894 (Central ACt IX of 1894), namely :\n(2)Quarrelling  with  other  prisoners",

While that being so, \nthe petitioner was issued with a charge memo on 18.07.2001 based \non an audit inspection.  It was alleged that there was a shortage of \n1,649 litres of diesel to the value of Rs.29,946/-.  After placing the \npetitioner  under  suspension,  an  enquiry  was  conducted  and \nconsequently,  an  order  of  demotion  was  passed  on  11.03.2002 \nthereby  demoting  the  petitioner  as  Junior  Tradesman with  initial \nscale  of  pay  and  also  for  recovery  of  a  sum  of  Rs.17,968/-. \nAggrieved  against  the  same,  the  petitioner  preferred  an  appeal \nbefore the first respondent.  The Appellate Authority rejected the \nappeal  through his order  dated 10.07.2002.   Hence, the present \nwrit petition is filed before this Court.\n3.It  is  the  contention  of  the  petitioner  that  two  other \npersons  were  also  issued  with  charge  memo  along  with  the \npetitioner but no major punishment was imposed on them except \nordering two increments  cut.   Therefore,  it  is  contended by  the \npetitioner that apart form the merits of  the matter,  the order  of \npunishment imposed on the petitioner also suffers on the ground of \ndiscrimination. \n3\n4. The above writ petition is resisted by the respondents \nby filing a counter affidavit.\n5.I have perused the materials placed before the court and \nalso considered the arguments advanced on either side.\n6.The  petitioner  was  imposed  with  punishment  of \ndemotion  through  the  order  of  the  original  Authority  dated \n11.03.2002.  Aggrieved against the same, he preferred an appeal \nbefore the Appellate Authority.  But, a perusal of the order passed \nby the Appellate Authority would show that he has not applied his \nmind to the facts and circumstances of the case at all and on the \nother hand, he has passed the order mechanically by stating that \nthere  are  no  grounds  to  interfere  with  the  order  of  the  original \nauthority.\n7.Needless to say that the Appellate Authority also being \nthe fact finding Authority, has to necessarily go into the facts and \ncircumstances of the case and  give his own independent finding as \nto whether the order of punishment imposed on the petitioner by \nthe original Authority is sustainable or not.  On the other hand, the \nAppellate Authority has simply stated that there are no reasons to \ninterfere with the order of the original authority. Except saying so, \nno  other  discussions  or  reasons  are  found  in  the  order  of  the \nAppellate Authority.  Therefore, I am of the view that the order of \n4\nthe Appellate Authority is not sustainable on the sole reason that it \nappears to be an outcome of non application of mind resulting in a \nnon-speaking  order.   Consequently,  the  order  of  the  Appellate \nAuthority dated 10.07.2002  is set aside and the matter is remitted \nback  to  the  Appellate  Authority  viz.,  the  first  respondent  for \nconsidering  the  appeal  filed  by  the  petitioner,  on  merits  and  in \naccordance with law and to pass a detailed order afresh within a \nperiod of  two months from the date of  receipt  of  a copy of  this \norder.  It is made clear that the petitioner is at liberty to raise all \nthe grounds which he raised in this writ petition before the Appellate \nAuthority and it is for the Appellate Authority to consider the same \nand pass orders as stated supra.  With these observation, the writ \npetition  is  allowed  in  part,  by  setting  aside  the  order  of  the \nAppellate Authority and remitting the matter back to him for fresh \nconsideration as stated supra.   It  is  further  made clear  that the \npetitioner should furnish his fresh grounds, if any, within a period of \ntwo weeks from the date of receipt of a copy of this order.  On \nreceipt of such grounds, the Appellate Authority shall dispose of the \nappeal within two months thereafter.

Mr.V.Raghavachari\nFor Respondents .. Mr.K.Karthikeyan, G.A.\n*******\n2\nO R D E R\nThe amended prayer in the writ petition is for issuance of a writ \nof certiorari to quash the order passed by the second respondent dated \n8.4.2002,  as  confirmed  by  the  first  respondent  by  order  dated \n9.1.2003.  The matter arises under the Indian Stamp Act (Act) and the \nTamil  Nadu  Stamp  (Prevention  of  Under  Valuation  of  Instruments) \nRules, 1968.  \n2.The first petitioner is the mother of the third petitioner and the \nsecond petitioner is her son in law.  The petitioners purchased 'Punja' \ncultivable  lands  in  survey  No.1474/3,  Konneri  Kuppam  Village, \nKancheepuram Taluk, by three registered sale deeds dated 6.4.1997, \nregistered as document Nos.526/97, 1041/97 and 1042 of 1997, on \nthe  file  of  the  Sub-Registrar,  Joint-I,  Kancheepuram,  the  third \nrespondent.  Though the sale deeds were registered for more than 5 ½ \nyears, the third respondent refused to return the documents, stating \nthat the property purchased under the said documents ought to have \nbeen valued on square foot basis by adopting the guideline value for \nurban properties maintained in the Office of the third respondent.  The \ntotal  valuation of  all  the  three  sale  deeds  at  Rs.1,19,28,960/-  was \nfixed  as  against  the  valuation  mentioned  in  the  documents  at \nRs.1,23,120/-. \n3.It is stated that the first respondent without conducting any \n3\nenquiry under section 47(A) of the Act, returned the documents to the \nthird respondent, by proceedings dated 22.3.2000.  According to the \nfirst  respondent,   in  the  meeting  held  in  the  office  of  the  second \nrespondent on 19.1.2000, he was advised that the sale deeds  referred \nthe  lands  as  'nanja  thottakal'  lands  and  therefore,  the  documents \nshould  be  sent  back  to  the  third  respondent  for  determining  the \nmarket value of the property.   On receipt of the documents, the third \nrespondent  placed  the  same  before  the  District  Registrar, \nKancheepuram District, who conducted an inspection of the land and \nwas satisfied that during the relevant period, cultivation was done in \nthe  said  lands.   Accordingly,  the  District  Registrar,  determined  the \nvalue of one acre of punja land during 1997 as Rs.26,16,000/- and \nsubmitted a report to the second respondent.  Based on such report, \nthe second respondent by proceedings dated 8.4.2002, determined the \nmarket value at Rs.26,16,000/- per acre which was 1/3rd of the urban \nland  value.   Pursuant  thereto  by  proceedings  dated  8.4.2002,  the \nsecond respondent demanded stamp duty on the enhanced amount. \nThe petitioners' case is that from the date of registration of the sale \ndeeds i.e. on 6.4.1997, till the filing of the writ petition no enquiry was \nconducted under section 47(A) of the Act, to determine the market \nvalue of the land and the proceedings of the second respondent is \n4\nwholly without jurisdiction.  In this regard, reliance has been placed on \nthe  decision  of  this  Court   in  M/S PARKVIEW ENTERPRISES v. \nSTATE OF TAMIL NADU [AIR 1990 (MADRAS) 251].  It is further \nsubmitted  that  no enquiry  under  section 47  (A)  of  the  Act  can  be \nconducted after about twelve years after the date of the registration of \nthe three sale deeds, dated 6.4.1997.  As the documents were not \nreleased, the petitioners filed a writ petition in W.P.No.12080 of 2005, \nand  this  Court  by  order  dated  12.4.2005,  after  taking  note  of  the \nearlier orders passed by this Court, directed the first respondent to \nrelease  the  documents,  subject  to  the  usual  conditions.   The \npetitioners were directed to file an affidavit of undertaking that they \nwill  not  alienate  the  property  in  question  and  also  produce  the \ndocuments as and when required.  The documents were directed to be \nreleased with an endorsement that the documents are subject to the \nproceedings under  the  Indian Stamp Act.    Based  on the  direction \nissued, the petitioners filed the undertaking and the documents have \nbeen returned. \n4.The petitioners by relying upon the decision of this Court in \nKRISHNA.M  v.  THE  DISTRICT  COLLECTO,  ERODE  DISTRICT \n[(1998) 3 CTC 366], submitted that the sale deeds were registered \n5\non 6.4.1997, and the period of limitation to exercise the power under \nsection 47(A) of the Act, should have been done within a period of two \nyears  i.e.  on  or  before  6.4.1999  and  beyond  such  date,  the  third \nrespondent cannot resort to the power under section 47(A) of the Act. \nFurther, it is contended that even as per the  suo motu power of the \nCollector, which was fixed as five years by virtue of the amendment to \nthe Stamp Act, amending sub-section 3 of section 47(A) of the Act, the \npower  cannot be exercised  after  10.2.2000  and the time limit  for \nexercising  suo motu power, which was increased to five years from \ntwo years by Tamil Nadu Amendment Act 1 of 2000, cannot be applied \nto the petitioners case as the documents were registered much prior to \nthe amendment i.e. on 6.4.1997.  Further, it is submitted that without \nfollowing the procedure under section 47(A) of the Act,  the market \nvalue cannot be fixed based on the recommendations of the second \nrespondent  and more  than 14 years  have elapsed and there  is  no \njustification to demand enhanced stamp duty.  Reliance was placed on \nthe decision of the Hon'ble Division Bench of this Court in DISTRICT \nCOLLECTOR, ERODE DISTRICT, ERODE v. M.PONNUSAMY 2001 \n(2) CTC 449.  \n5.Initially,  the  petitioners  sought  for  issuance  of  a  writ  of \n6\nmandamus to direct the respondents to remove the endorsement in \nthe documents stating that proceedings under section 47(A) of the Act \nis  pending  as  the  proceedings  has  become  time  barred  and  for  a \nconsequential direction to the third respondent to return the document \nwithout  such  endorsement.   Subsequently,  the  prayer  in  the  writ \npetition was amended to quash the order of the second respondent \ndated 8.4.2002 and the order of the first respondent dated 9.1.2003, \nwhich prayer was allowed by this Court by order dated 15.3.2013 in \nM.P.No.1 of 2013. \n6.In  the  counter  affidavit  filed  by  the  third  respondent,  it  is \nadmitted that the documents were registered and the documents were \nadmitted for registration as they were mentioned as agricultural lands. \nBased on the inspection done by the District Registrar, it was found \nthat  the  lands  were  in  a  developed  area  and  the  petitioners  have \nshown  a  lesser  value  than  the  guideline  value  and  therefore,  the \nDistrict Registrar fixed the value at Rs.26,16,000/- per acre and after \nexamining the report of the District Registrar, the Deputy Inspector \nGeneral  of  Registration recommended the said value to be adopted \nwhich was accepted by the second respondent and accordingly, the \nproceedings  dated  8.4.2002  was  issued  by  the  second  respondent, \n7\nfixing the value of the land at Rs. 26,16,000/-. It is further stated that \non  2.9.2002,  the  first  petitioner  submitted  a  representation  stating \nthat they have paid the stamp duty in accordance with the guideline \nvalue  fixed  during  1997,  as  the  lands  have  been  classified  as \nagricultural land and the determination of guideline value after 5 ½ \nyears is arbitrary and without jurisdiction and requested for return of \nthe documents.",

Respondent \n Criminal Original Petition is filed under Section 482 of the Code \nof Criminal Procedure, praying to call for the records in C.C.No.10724 \nof 2008 on the file of XVII Metropolitan Magistrate, Saidapet, Chennai \nand to quash the same.\nFor Petitioner   : Mr.Govi Ganesan.\nFor Respondent : Mr.L.Rajasekar.\nO R D E R\nThe petitioner herein, who is the accused in CC.No.10724/2008 \nhas come forward with this petition to quash the criminal prosecution \ninitiated by the respondent/complainant for the offence under Section \n138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act.\n2.The complaint proceeds as if the complainant is a partnership \nfirm doing the money lending business and hire purchase finance and \nthe  accused  is  the  Chairman  of  M/s.SRM Group  of  companies  and \n2\nVice-Chancellor  of  SRM Deemed  University  and  the  accused  in  the \ncourse  of  his  business  obtained  loan  of  Rs.60,00,000/-  from  the \ncomplainant and issued a cheque drawn on M/s.Tamil Nadu Mercantile \nBank  Ltd,  T.Nagar  branch  dated  16.08.2004  for  Rs.50,00,000/- \ntowards part payment of the amount borrowed and when the cheque \nwas presented for collection in the complainant bank, the same was \nreturned unpaid for want of sufficient funds vide memorandum dated \n16.02.2005.   The  same was  intimated to  the  complainant  and  the \ncomplainant  forwarded  a  letter  dated  26.02.2005  to  the  accused \nthereby  intimating  him  about  the  dishonour  of  the  cheque.  The \naccused  though  acknowledged  the  same  vide  his  letter  dated \n03.03.2005 denied his liability. \n3.  It  is  the specific  case of  the complainant that the accused \nissued the cheque, which was later dishonoured only with an intention \nto defraud the complainant. The paragraphs 8 to 11 of the complaint \nproceed to explain the circumstances under which the accused lodged \nthe  complaint  against  the  complainant's  auditor  by  name \nK.Subramaniam for  the alleged offence under  Section 420  IPC and \nenquiry held on the same, summons issued to the accused for  the \nenquiry, and the seizure of the cheque in question bearing No.208775 \n3\ndated 16.8.2004 pertaining to the case and the persistent refusal on \nthe  part  of  the  police  authority  to  return  the  original  cheque, \ncircumstances under  which the private complaint  is  instituted along \nwith the photo copy of the cheque in question and the complaint was \ntaken up on file as C.C.No.10724 of 2008 by the XVII Metropolitan \nMagistrate,  Saidapet,  Chennai,  arising  out  of  which  is  the  present \npetition.   \n4. The accused has in this  criminal  original  petition sought to \nquash  the  criminal  proceedings  mainly  on  the  ground  that  the \ncommunication dated 26.02.2005 about the dishonour of the cheque \nissued by the complainant to the accused in the form of letter, fall \nshort of its requirement of statutory notice under Section 138(b) of the \nNegotiable Instrument Act.  In the absence of issuance of one such \nnotice along with the demand for payment of the amount mentioned in \nthe  cheque  no  cause  of  action  arises  for  instituting  the  private \ncomplaint  and  the  private  complaint  is  premature  and  is  not \nmaintainable in law.   \n5.  Whereas  the  learned  counsel  for  the  respondent/defacto \ncomplainant  would  try  to  impress  upon  the  court  that  there  is  no \nprescribed form for the statutory demand notice to be issued under \n4\nClause (b) of proviso to Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act \nand the contents of notice dated 26.02.2005 constitute valid demand \nfor  repayment  of  the  cheque  amount  and  satisfies  the  statutory \nrequirement of Clause (b) of proviso to Section 138 of the Negotiable \nInstruments Act.  \n6.Heard the rival submissions made on both sides.\n7.For the purpose of better appreciation, the contents of copy of \nthe letter dated 26.02.2005 sent by the complainant to the accused \nenclosed at  Page 5 of  the typed set of  papers  shall  be reproduced \nherein and the same are as follows :\n\"We  would  like  to  kindly  inform  you  that  we  had \npresented  the  cheque  for  an  amount  of  Rs.50,00,000/- \nbearing No.208775 dated 16.08.2004 drawn on Tamil Nadu \nMercantile Bank has come back to us from the bank.\nKindly do the needful.\nThanking your with regards\nfor M.M.Finance Corporation.\"\n8.It is not in dispute that except this communication, there is no \nother communication either in the form of letter or notice issued to the \naccused regarding dishonour of cheque.  It is equally not disputed that \nthe  communication  dated  26.02.2005  is  through  letter  dated \n5\n03.03.2005 replied by denying the very issuance of cheque, that too \nfor discharge of any liability between the parties.\n9.Before going into the validity of the ground raised herein on \nmerits it is but relevant to read Clause (b) of proviso to Sec.138 of \nN.I.Act which is extracted hereunder: \n\"the payee or the holder in due course of the cheque, \nas the case may be makes a demand for the payment of \nthe said amount of money by giving a notice in writing, to \nthe drawer of the cheque, (within thirty days) of the receipt \nof information by him from the bank regarding the return of \nthe cheque as unpaid\".\n10.The reading of the provision of law as extracted above would \nreveal that the same does not prescribe any specified form of such \nstatutory  notice.  The  Hon'ble  Supreme  Court  in Central  Bank  of \nIndia V. Saxons Farms (1999) 8 SCC 221 clearly observed \"though \nno form of notice is prescribed in clause Cl.(b) of the proviso to Section \n138, the requirement is that the notice shall be given in writing within \n15 days of receipt of information from the bank regarding return of the \ncheque as unpaid and in the notice,  a demand for  payment of  the \namount of the cheque has to be made.\"\n11.The Supreme Court has in other judgment  K.Bhaksaran V. \n6\nSankaran Vaidyhyam Balan in (1999) 7 SCC 510 further observed \n\"under Cl.(b) of the proviso to S.138 of the Act the payee has the \nstatutory obligation to make a demand by giving notice.  The  thrust in \nthe clause is on the need to make a demand.  It is only the mode for \nmaking  such  demand  which  the  legislature  has  prescribed.\"   It  is \nobserved  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  Krishna  exports  V.  Rajudas \n(2004) 13 SCC 498   \"even the letter by the complainant requiring \nthe amount of payment of cheque to be arranged failing which to take \nlegal action in the matter certainly qualified itself as a notice within the \ncontemplation of Cl(c)\".  \n12.Thus, the decisions of the Hon'ble Supreme Court and our \nHigh Court would make it abundantly clear that the statutory notice \nissued under Cl.(b)(ii) to Sec.138 shall be in any form and the main \nrequirement is that it shall contain demand for the immediate payment \nof the amount of cheque within the time specified therein.\n13.In this case, if the contents of letter dated 26.02.2005 which \nis admittedly construed to be the statutory notice, is appreciated in the \nlight of above cited legal principles, the same cannot be held to be \nproper notice as contemplated under Cl(b).  As already referred to, it \n7\nis only in the form of information to the petitioner herein, about the \ndishonour of the cheque and there is no demand for repayment of the \namount. The recital to the effect \"kindly do the needful\" is in the form \nof request and fall short of demand.  The request 'to do the needful' \ncannot  be  at  any  stretch  of  imagination  construed  as  demand  for \nimmediate  repayment  of  the  cheque  amount  and  the  failure  of \ncompliance of the same cannot give rise to any cause of action for \ninitiating  criminal  proceedings  under  Section  138  of  the  Negotiable \nInstruments Act.\n14.The same view is fortified by the Hon'ble Supreme Court in \nthe following judgments cited on the side of the petitioner (i)2000 (2) \nSCC 380 (Suman Sethi v.  Ajay K. Churiwal) (ii)2003 (4) CTC \n252 K.R.Indira V. Dr.G.Adinarayana and (iii)2007 (5) CTC 876 \nRahul Builders V. Arihant Fertilizers and chemical and another. \nIn  all  three  cases  cited  above,  the  Hon'ble  Apex  Court  dealt  with \nsimilar  issue  and  decided  the  same  in  favour  of  the  accused.",

SIKRI, J.\nThe appellants herein, two in number, are the daughters of one,\nGurulingappa Savadi, propositus of a Hindu Joint Family.  Apart from\nthese two daughters, he had two sons, namely, Arunkumar and Vijay.\nGurulingappa Savadi died in the year 2001 leaving behind the aforesaid\ntwo daughters, two sons and his widow, Sumitra.  After his death, Amar,\nS/o Arunkumar filed the suit for partition and a separate possession of\nthe suit property described at Schedule B to E in the plaint stating that\nthe  two  sons  and  widow  were  in  joint  possession  of  the  aforesaid\nproperties as coparceners and properties mentioned in Schedule B was\nacquired out  of  the joint  family nucleus in the name of  Gurulingappa\nSavadi.  Case set up by him was that the appellants herein were not the\ncoparceners  in  the  said  joint  family  as  they  were  born  prior  to  the\n2\nenactment of Hindu Succession Act, 1956 (hereinafter referred to as the\n‘Act’).  It was also pleaded that they were married daughters and at the\ntime  of  their  marriage  they  had  received  gold  and  money and  had,\nhence, relinquished their share.  \n2) The appellants herein contested the suit by claiming that they were also\nentitled  to  share  in  the  joint  family  properties,  being  daughters  of\nGurulingappa Savadi and for the reason that he had died after coming\ninto force the Act of 1950.  \n3) The trial court, while decreeing the suit held that the appellants were not\nentitled to any share as they were born prior to the enactment of the Act\nand, therefore, could not be considered as coparceners.  The trial court\nalso rejected the alternate contention that the appellants had acquired\nshare in the said properties, in any case, after the amendment in the Act\nvide amendment  Act  of  2005.   This  view of  the trial  court  has been\nupheld by the High Court in the impugned judgement dated January 25,\n2012 thereby confirming the decree dated August 09, 2007 passed in\nthe suit filed for partition.  \n4) In  the  aforesaid  backdrop,  the  question  of  law  which  arises  for\nconsideration in this appeal is as to whether, the appellants, daughters\nof Gurulingappa Savadi, could be denied their share on the ground that\nthey were born prior to the enactment of the Act and, therefore, cannot\nbe treated as coparceners?  Alternate question is as to whether, with the\n3\npassing of  Hindu Succession (Amendment)  Act,  2005,  the appellants\nwould  become coparcener  “by  birth”  in  their  “own  right  in  the  same\nmanner as the son” and are, therefore, entitled to equal share as that of\na son?  \n5) Though, we have mentioned the gist of the lis involved in this case along\nwith brief factual background in which it  has arisen, some more facts\nwhich may be necessary for understanding the genesis of issue involved\nmay also be recapitulated.   We may start  with  the genealogy of  the\nparties, it is as under:\n“ Guralingappa=Sumitra\n     (Def.8)\n---------------------------------------------------------------\nMahandanda    Arunkumar @ Arun=Sarojini Vijay    Danamma\n(Def. 7)      (Def.1) (dead)      (Def.2)   (Def.5)  (Def. 6)\n----------------------------------------------\n      Sheetal      Amar       Triveni\n    (Def. 3)       (Plff)  (Def. 4) ”\n6)  Respondent No. 1 herein (the plaintiff) filed the suit on July 01, 2002\nclaiming 1/15th share in the suit schedule properties. In the said suit, he\nmentioned the properties which needed partition.\n7) The plaint schedule C compromised of the house properties belonging to\nthe joint family.  The plaint schedule D comprised of the shop properties\n4\nbelonging to the joint family.  The plaint schedule E comprised of the\nmachineries  and  movable  belonging  to  the  joint  family.  The  plaintiff\naverred that the plaint schedule properties belonged to the joint family\nand that defendant no. 1, the father of the plaintiff was neglecting the\nplaintiff  and  his  siblings  and  sought  partition  of  the  suit  schedule\nproperties.  The plaintiff contended that all the suit schedule properties\nwere the joint family properties.  The plaintiff contended in para 5 of the\nplaint that the propositus, Guralingappa died 1 year prior to the filing of\nthe suit.  In para 7 of the plaint, the plaintiff contended that defendant no.\n1 had 1/3rd share and defendant no. 5 and 8 had 1/3rd share each in the\nsuit schedule properties.  The plaintiff also contended that defendants 6\nand 7 did not have any share in the suit schedule properties.\n8)Defendant no. 1 (father of the plaintiff) and son of  Guralingappa Savadi\ndid not file any written statement.  Defendant nos. 2, 3 and 4 filed their\nseparate  written  statements  supporting  the  claim  of  the  plaintiff.\nDefendant  no.  5  (respondent  no.  5  herein  and  son  of  Guralingappa\nSavadi), however, contested the suit.  He, inter alia, contended that after\nthe  death  of  Guralingappa,  an  oral  partition  took  place  between\ndefendant no. 1, defendant no. 5 and others and in the said partition,\ndefendant no. 1 was allotted certain properties and defendant no. 5 was\nallotted certain other properties and defendant no. 8, Sumitra, wife of\nGuralingappa Savadi was allotted certain other properties.  Defendant\n5\nno. 5 further contended that defendant nos. 6 and 7 were not allotted\nany properties in the said alleged oral partition.\n9)Defendant no. 5 further contended that one of the properties, namely,\nC.T.S. No. 774 and also certain other properties were not joint family\nproperties.  \n10) The appellants claimed that they were also entitled to their share in\nthe property.  After framing the issues and recording the evidence, the\ntrial court by its judgment and decree dated August 09, 2007 held that\nthe suit schedule properties were joint family properties except CTS No.\n774 (one of the house properties in plaint C schedule).  \n11) The trial court held that the plaintiff, defendant nos. 2 to 4 were\nentitled to 1/8th share in the joint family properties.  The trial court further\nnoted that defendant no. 8 (wife of Gurulingappa Savadi) died during the\npendency  of  the  suit  intestate  and  her  share  devolved  in  favour  of\ndefendants no. 1 and 5 only and, therefore, defendant nos. 1 and 2 were\nentitled to ½ share in the said share.  The trial court passed the following\norder:\n“The suit of the plaintiff is decreed holding that the plaintiff\nis  entitled  for  partition  and separate  possession  of  his\n1/8th share in the suit ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’ schedule properties\n(except  CTS  No.  774)  and  also  in  respect  of  the\nMachinery’s  stated  in  the  report  of  the  commissioner.\nThe commissioners report Ex. P16 which contains the list\nof machinery’s to form part of the decree.\n6\nThe defendants 2 to 4 are each entitled to a/8th share and\nthe 5th defendant is entitled for  4/8 share in the above\nsaid properties.”\n12) The trial court, thus, denied any share to the appellants.\n13) Aggrieved by the said judgment and decree of the trial court, the\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 filed an appeal bearing R.F.A. No. 322 of 2008\nbefore the High Court seeking equal share as that of the sons of the\npropositus, namely, defendant nos. 1 and 5.  \n14) The High Court by its impugned judgment and order dated January\n25,  2012  dismissed  the  appeal.  Thereafter,  on  March  04,  2012\ndefendant nos. 6 and 7 filed a review petition bearing no. 1533 of 2012\nbefore the High Court, which met the same fate.  \n15) We have heard the learned counsel for the parties.  Whereas, the\nlearned counsel for the appellants reiterated his submissions which were\nmade before the High Court as well and noted above, learned counsel\nfor  the  respondents  refuted  those  submissions  by  relying  upon  the\nreason given by the High Court in the impugned judgment.  \n16) In the first instance, let us take note of the provisions of Section 6\nof the Act, as it stood prior to its amendment by the Amendment Act,\n2005.  This provision reads as under:\n“6. Devolution  of  interest  in  coparcenary  property.—When  a\nmale Hindu dies after the commencement of this Act, having at\n7\nthe time of his death an interest in a Mitakshara coparcenary\nproperty,  his  interest  in  the  property  shall  devolve  by\nsurvivorship upon the surviving members of the coparcenary\nand not in accordance with this Act:\nProvided that, if  the deceased had left  him surviving a\nfemale relative specified in Class I of the Schedule or a male\nrelative specified in that class who claims through such female\nrelative,  the  interest  of  the  deceased  in  the  Mitakshara\ncoparcenary  property  shall  devolve  by  testamentary  or\nintestate succession, as the case may be, under this Act and\nnot by survivorship.\nExplanation  1.—For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  the\ninterest of a Hindu Mitakshara coparcener shall be deemed to\nbe the share in the property that would have been allotted to\nhim if a partition of the property had taken place immediately\nbefore his  death,  irrespective of  whether  he  was  entitled  to\nclaim partition or not.",

SIKRI, J.\nThese matters were listed for hearing on January 18, 2018.  The\ncounsel for  the respondents did not  appear though the matters were\npassed over once and were called again for the second time.  In these\ncircumstances,  we  heard  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the\nappellant  and  reserved  the  judgment.   However, in  order  to  give an\n2\nopportunity, this Court granted one week’s time to the respondents to file\ntheir written submissions.  Even when more than one week has lapsed,\nno written submissions have been filed by the respondents.  In these\ncircumstances,  we  have  ourselves  perused  the  entire  record  while\nconsidering the submissions of the appellant’s counsel.\n2) The  appellant  herein  is  the  owner  of  the  premises  situated  in  Main\nBazar, Old Najafgarh Road, Bahadurgarh, Haryana.  In these premises\nfew shops were constructed in mid 1960s1 by the father of the appellant\nand one shop each was let out by the respondents in these appeals.\nThe premises are governed by the Haryana Urban (Control of Rent and\nEviction) Act,  1973 (hereinafter  referred to as the ‘Act’)  as per which\ntenants can be evicted only on certain specified grounds.  One of the\ngrounds for eviction is that the premises let out is in dilapidated condition\nand cannot be repaired/reconstructed without evicting the tenant.  The\nappellant filed eviction petitions against the respondents before the Rent\nController, Bahadurgarh, under Section 13 of the Act on the ground that\nthe shops which are built up on mud had become unsafe, inhabitable\nand were in dilapidated condition.  The Rent Controller was pleased to\ndismiss  the  eviction  petitions  after  recording  a  finding  that  tenanted\npremises were not in a dilapidated condition.  The appeal was preferred\nby the appellant  against  the orders of  the Rent Controller  before the\n1  Though respondents had disputed the year of construction and \naccording to them construction was carried out 30-40 years ago only.\n3\nAdditional District Judge-cum-Appellate Authority under the Act.  These\nappeals were also dismissed.  Thereafter, the appellant  filed revision\npetitions, which have also been dismissed by the High Court.  Identical\norders are passed dismissing these revision petitions and the operative\nportion of order dated July 09, 2015 passed by the High Court in the\nrevision petitions is as follows:\n“In  the  present  case,  petitioner  had  sought  ejectment  of\nrespondent No.1 from the shop in question on the ground that\nit had been rendered unfit and unsafe for human habitation.\nIn  this  regard,  petitioner  examined  his  expert.  Respondent\nNo.1 also examined his expert to establish that the premises\nin question was fit for human habitation.  The Courts below\nafter  going  through  the  reports  of  the  expert  and  the\nphotographs, placed on record, came to the conclusion that\nthe premises in question was fit for human habitation.  In fact,\nthe  shop  in  question  had  not  been  got  repaired  by  the\npetitioner.\nIn  the  facts  and circumstances  of  the  present  case,  no\nground for interference with the finding of fact arrived at by\nthe Courts below, is made out.” \n3) The learned counsel for the appellant has made twofold submissions.  In\nthe first  place,  it  was  argued that  during the course  of  the trial,  the\nappellant had placed on record the report of an expert, viz., an Engineer\nwho was also examined as PW-3.  He also filed an affidavit stating that\nhe had carried out physical inspection of the shop and gave a detailed\nreport dated March 10, 2006, which was exhibited as Exhibit P-2.  The\ncondition  mentioned  by  him  finds  mention  at  pages  29  and  30  in\nparagraph 19 of  the judgment dated April  30,  2010 of  the trial  court.\n4\nRelying on that report, learned counsel for the appellant argued that it\nspeaks  volumes  about  the  state  of  existing  construction  and  clearly\nshows that the shop in question is in a dilapidated condition.  It states\nthat cracks have been developed in the superstructure walls, RCC slabs\nof the stairs, roof projection.  It also mentions that cement plaster has\nbeen eroded at some places leaving the bricks in the walls as naked and\nthe naked walls have been eroded leaving their joints and coming out of\nthe superstructure walls due to sudden dampness, efflorescence in walls\ncaused by wash/waste water drains passing along with the rear walls of\nthe shop.  It  also states that the roof projection deflected and cracks\ndeveloped may cause heavy damage due to sudden collapse at  any\ntime.  It also states that floor level of the shop is lower than the existing\nmain  road  level,  thus,  attracting  dampness  from rain  water  and  dry\nweather  flow.   Learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that,  no\ndoubt, the respondents had also examined a retired Engineer as RW-4,\nwho  had  filed  his  affidavit  and  his  report  was  accepted  as  R-1.\nHowever, the report filed by RW-4 did not discuss the conditions of the\nshops and it  only  mentioned about  the  photographs  of  the  roof  and\nflooring which was taken with the help of a digital camera and the report\nalso mentioned about Chhajja in the front side stating it to be in a good\ncondition.  He, thus, submitted that the findings of the courts below were\ntotally perverse which relied upon the report of RW-4 and ignored the\n5\nreport of PW-3.\n4) Second submission of the learned counsel for the appellant was that the\nsubsequent  events  which  happened  fortified  the  report  of  PW-3\ninasmuch as in the year 2012, when the appeal of the appellant was\npending before the Additional District Judge-cum-Appellate Authority, the\nChhajja had fallen down.  This event, according to him, proves that the\npremises  are  in  dilapidated  condition  and  unsafe  for  habitation.   He\nsubmitted that  even when this  fact  was  brought  to  the notice  of  the\nAppellate Authority as well  as the High Court,  these courts have not\ntaken note of this subsequent development, though they were supposed\nto  look  into  the  same.   On this  ground  also  it  was  argued  that  the\nfindings of the courts below are perverse.\n5) In his judgment dated April 30, 2010, the Rent Controller discussed the\nexpert evidence led by both the parties and after detailed examination of\nboth the reports, he formed an opinion that the appellant was not able to\nprove that the shops were in a dilapidated condition.  Discussion on this\naspect runs as follows:\n“23. In the opinion of the court, the petitioners have not been\nable to prove that the shop is in dilapidated condition.  On\nperusal of photographs Ex.R3, it is evident that the roof of the\nshop has been consisting of wooden battons.  It has come in\nthe cross-examination of PW2 Surender that ever since the\nshop has been let  out  to the respondent,  they have never\nbothered to get the same repaired or white-washed.  Their\nown  witness  of  petitioners  PW4  Parveen  Kumar  has  also\n6\nstated  in  the  cross-examination  that  the  shop of  Nand Lal\nfrom  outside  is  in  good  condition.    He  also  stated  that\nbetween his shop and the shop of Varinder no other shops is\nthere and the stairs of his shop are broken and had cracks but\nthe remaining shop is  fine.   PW3 Sunil  stated in his  cross\nexamination all the four shops where the construction at the\nsame  time.   Since  PW4  Parveen  stated  in  his\ncross-examination that except four stairs his shop is fine and\nthat all the shops were constructions together, it is improbable\nthat one shop is about to fall being dilapidated and the other\nshop is fine.  Beside this, PW1 Sh.R.Punia has stated in his\ncross-examination that he has not mentioned in the report the\nsize of the plaster which has eroded from the walls and at\nwhat places.”\n6)  Thus, after examining the expert witnesses who are produced by both\nsides, the Rent Controller returned the aforesaid findings, which findings\nwere approved by the Appellate Authority as well in its judgment dated\nSeptember 17, 2012.  We find that the view taken was plausible view\nwhich cannot be considered as perverse.  The revisionary jurisdiction of\nthe  High  Court  is  limited  and,  therefore,  it  rightly  observed  that  no\nground for interference with the finding of fact arrived at by the courts\nbelow was made out.\n \n7) Insofar as the contention of the appellant based on alleged subsequent\nevent is concerned, except arguing that it was taken before the appellate\ncourt as well as the High Court, no material is produced to support this\nsubmission.  Grounds of appeal filed before the Appellate Authority or\nthe  copy  of  the  revision  petition  has  not  been  placed  on  record.\nMoreover, judgments of the Appellate Authority as well as the High Court\n7\ndo not reflect that such a contention was raised before the said courts.\nIn the absence thereof, the alleged subsequent event cannot be taken\ninto consideration.\n8) We,  therefore,  do  not  find  any  merit  in  these  appeals  which  are\naccordingly dismissed.\nHowever,  if  the  condition  of  the  premises,  as  of  today,  is\ndilapidated  and  the  appellant  is  correct  in  his  submission  that  the\nChhajja  of the premises had fallen down in the year 2012, it would be\nopen to the appellant to file a fresh petition on the aforesaid ground as\nthese events would furnish a fresh cause of action to the appellant.\n.............................................J.\n(A.K.

            "content":"1\nREPORTABLE\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\nCIVIL APPEAL NO. 11261 OF 2016\nCOMMISSIONER OF CENTRAL EXCISE \nSERVICE TAX .....APPELLANT(S)\nVERSUS\nULTRA TECH CEMENT LTD. .....RESPONDENT(S)\nJ U D G M E N T\nA.K. SIKRI, J.\nThe core issue involved in the present case is with regard to the\nadmissibility  or  otherwise  of  the  Cenvat  Credit  on  Goods  Transport\nAgency service availed for transport of goods from the place of removal\nto  buyer’s  premises.   This  issue  has  arisen  in  the  following  factual\nbackground:\nThe respondent M/s. Ultratech Cement Ltd. (hereinafter referred to\nas  the  ‘assessee’)  is  involved  in  packing  and  clearing/forwarding  of\ncement  classifiable  under  Chapter  sub  heading  25232910  of  Central\nExcise  Tariff  Act,  1985,  with  Central  Excise  Registration  No.\nAAACL6442LEM014.   The  assessee  is  also  availing  the  benefit  of\n2\nCenvat Credit facility under the Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004 (‘Rules, 2004’\nfor short).  The assesseeherein gets finished goods (cement) from its\nparent unit on stock transfer basis and sells the same in bulk form and\npacked bags.  The assessee during the period from January, 2010 to\nJune,  2010  availed  Cenvat  Credit  of  service  tax  paid  on  outward\ntransportation of goods through a transport agency from their premises\nto the customer’s premises.  According to the appellant/Revenue, the\ntransport agency service used by the assessee for transportation of their\nfinal  product  from  their  premises  to  customers  premises  cannot  be\nconsidered  to  have  been  used  directly  or  indirectly  in  relation  to\nclearance of goods from the factory viz., place of removal in terms of\nRule 2(l) of the Rules and as such cannot be considered as input service\nto avail Cenvat credit.  \nAccordingly,  the  Office  of  the  Commissioner  of  Central  Excise:\nBangalore II Commissionerate issued show cause notice dated February\n3, 2011 to the assessee inter alia stating that on scrutiny of ER-1 return\nsubmitted by the assessee for the period January, 2010 to June, 2010, it\nwas noticed that the assessee have wrongly availed the Cenvat Credit of\nService Tax paid on outward transportation of goods from the factory to\nthe  Customer’s  premises,  inasmuch  as  the  Goods  Transport  Agency\nService  used for the purpose of outward transportation of the goods\nfrom factory to customer’s premises is not input service within the ambit\n3\nof Rule 2(l)(ii) of the Rules, 2004.  It was further mentioned that the total\nCenvat  Credit  claimed  was  in  the  sum  of  Rs.  25,66,131/-  and  the\nassessee was called upon to show cause as to why the said amount be\nnot recovered and penalty be not imposed.  The assessee submitted its\nreply to the show cause notice contesting the position contained therein.\n2) After hearing, the Adjudicating Authority passed Order-in-Original dated\nAugust 22, 2011 holding that once the final products are cleared from\nthe factory premises, extending the credit beyond the point of clearance\nof final product is not permissible under Cenvat Credit Rules and post\nclearance use of services in transport of manufactured goods cannot be\ninput  service  for  the  manufacture  of  final  product.   Further,  the\nAdjudicating Authority held that CBEC vide its Circular No. 97/8/2007-ST\ndated August 23, 2007 has clarified the definition of place of removal.\nWith respect to fulfillment of requirement of Circular dated August 23,\n2007, it was held that the assessee has not produced any documentary\nevidence to prove that conditions laid down vide Circular dated August\n23,  2007  has  been  fulfilled.   Accordingly,  the  Adjudicating  Authority\npassed the order as under:\n“(i)   Demanding  the  irregular  Cenvat  credit  availed  on\noutward  transportation  of  goods  amounting  to\nRs.25,66,131/- under Rule 14 of Cenvat Credit Rules, 2004\nread with Section 11A of Central Excise Act, 1944;\n(ii)   Demanding  interest  under  Rule  14  of  Cenvat  Credit\nRules, 2004 read with Section 11AB of Central Excise Act,\n1944 read with Section 75 of the Finance Act, 1994;\n4\n(iii)  Did not order for initiation of action under Rule 15(1) of\nCenvat  Credit  Rules,  2004  read  with  Rule  25  of  Central\nExcise Rules, 2002;\n(iv)  Imposed penalty of Rs.25,66,131/- under Rule 15(3) of\nCenvat Credit Rules, 2004;\n(v)   Imposed  penalty  of  Rs.1,00,000/-  under  Rule  25  of\nCentral Excise Rules, 2002.” \n3) Aggrieved by the Order-in-Original No. 24/2011 dated August 22, 2011,\nrespondent/assessee  preferred  an  appeal  before  Commissioner\n(Appeals).   The  Commissioner  (Appeals)  vide  Order-in-Appeal  No.\n57/2012-CE dated March 15, 2012 allowed the appeal and set aside the\nOrder-in-Original  holding  that  assessee  is  eligible  for  availment  of\nservice tax paid on GTA service on the outward freight from the factory\nto  the  customers’  premises  as  per  the  Board’s  Circular\n97/8/2007-Service Tax dated August 23, 2007.  It was now the turn of\nthe Revenue to feel aggrieved by the order.  Accordingly, appeal was\nfiled  before  the  Customs,  Excise  and  Service  Tax  Appellate  Tribunal\n(CESTAT) by the Revenue which was rejected vide judgment dated May\n1, 2015.  Further appeal to the High Court preferred by the assessee\nhas met the same fate as the said appeal has been dismissed by the\nHigh Court of Karnataka vide its judgment dated June 29, 2016, which is\nthe subject matter of the present appeal.  \n4) As mentioned above, the assessee is involved in packing and clearing of\n5\ncement.  It is supposed to pay the service tax on the aforesaid services.\nAt the same time, it is entitled to avail the benefit of Cenvat Credit in\nrespect of any input service tax paid.  In the instant case, input service\ntax  was  also  paid  on  the  outward  transportation  of  the  goods  from\nfactory to the customer’s premises of which the assessee claimed the\ncredit.  The question is as to whether it can be treated as ‘input service’.\n5) ‘Input service’ is defined in Rule 2(l) of the Rules, 2004 which reads as\nunder:\n“2(l) “input service” means any service:-\n(i)  Used by a provider of taxable service for providing an\noutput services; or\n(ii) Used  by  the  manufacturer,  whether  directly  or\nindirectly, in or in relation to the manufacture of final\nproducts  and  clearance  of  final  products  upto  the\nplace  of  removal  and  includes  services  used  in\nrelation  to  setting  up,  modernization,  renovation  or\nrepairs  of  a  factory,  premises  of  provider  of  output\nservice  or  an  office  relating  to  such  factory  or\npremises,  advertisement  or  sales promotion,  market\nresearch,  storage  upto  the  place  of  removal,\nprocurement of inputs, activities relating to business,\nsuch  as  accounting,  auditing,  financing  recruitment\nand quality control,  coaching and training, computer\nnetworking, credit rating, share registry, and security,\ninward transportation of  inputs or  capital  goods and\noutward transportation upto the place of removal;”\n \n6) It is an admitted position that the instant case does not fall in sub-clause\n(i) and the issue is to be decided on the application of sub-clause (ii).\nReading of the aforesaid provision makes it clear that those services are\n6\nincluded  which  are  used  by  the  manufacturer,  whether  directly  or\nindirectly,  in  or  in  relation  to  the  manufacture  of  final  products  and\nclearance of final products ‘upto the place of removal’.\n7) It may be relevant to point out here that the original definition of ‘input\nservice’ contained in Rule 2(l) of the Rules, 2004 used the expression\n‘from the place of removal’.  As per the said definition, service used by\nthe  manufacturer  of  clearance  of  final  products  ‘from  the  place  of\nremoval’  to  the warehouse or  customer’s place etc.,  was exigible for\nCenvat Credit.  This stands finally decided in Civil Appeal No. 11710 of\n2016  (Commissioner  of  Central   Excise  Belgaum v.  M/s.\nVasavadatta  Cements Ltd.)  vide judgment  dated January 17,  2018.\nHowever, vide amendment carried out in the aforesaid Rules in the year\n2008, which became effective from March 1, 2008, the word ‘from’ is\nreplaced by the word ‘upto’.  Thus, it is only ‘upto the place of removal’\nthat service is treated as input service.  This amendment has changed\nthe entire scenario.  The benefit which was admissible even beyond the\nplace of removal now gets terminated at the place of removal and doors\nto the cenvat credit  of input tax paid gets closed at that place.  This\ncredit cannot travel therefrom.  It becomes clear from the bare reading of\nthis  amended Rule,  which  applies  to  the  period  in  question  that  the\nGoods  Transport  Agency  service  used  for  the  purpose  of  outward\ntransportation of goods, i.e. from the factory to customer’s premises, is\n7\nnot covered within the ambit of Rule 2(l)(i) of Rules, 2004.",

V. Ramana, J.\n1. This criminal appeal arises from the impugned judgment, and\norder,  dated  20.11.2008,  in  Criminal  Appeal  No.  379/2007\npassed by the High Court of Judicature at Bombay, wherein\nthe  High  Court  acquitted  the  respondent  no.1  of  all  the\ncharges under sections 8(c), punishable under Section 20(b)(ii)\n(c) and under Section 28 read with Section 23 of The Narcotic\nDrugs  and  Psychotropic  Substances  Act,  1985  (hereinafter\nreferred to as ‘N.D.P.S Act’).\n2\n2. A brief reference to the prosecution case may be necessary for\ndisposal of this case. On 05.05.2004, the officers of Customs,\nAir  Intelligence  Unit,  at  Chhatrapati  Shivaji  International\nAirport, Mumbai noticed that a passenger of European origin\nwas  found  to  be  suspiciously  loitering  near  the  airline\ncounters of Swiss Air. Observing such suspicious behavior, the\nairline personnel were alerted for segregating the baggage of\nthe  respondent  no.1.  After  completing  his  immigration  and\ncustom formalities,  respondent  no.1  was intercepted by  the\nIntelligence Officer and subjected to examination by a sniffer\ndog. \n3. When there was an indication about the presence of narcotic\nor  psychotropic  substance,  he  was  taken  to  a  baggage\nexamination  area.  On  opening  suit  case  his  personal\nbelongings were kept aside, even then, his suit case was found\nto be abnormally heavy. On examination, a false bottom was\ndetected  and  when  the  false  bottom  was  removed,  three\nrectangular  packets  wrapped  in  cellophane  tape  were\ndiscovered containing brown colored substance which tested\npositive  for  hashish,  a contraband substance.  Net weight of\n3\nthe recovered substance was found to be measuring 12.03 Kg.\nLater,  the  samples  were  drawn  and  the  goods  were  seized\nunder  a  seizure  panchnama.  It  is  to  be  noted  that,  on\n06.05.2004,  respondent  no.1  recorded  his  statement  under\nSection  67  of  N.D.P.S  Act.  After  completion  of  the\ninvestigation,  charges  levelled  against  him,  the  accused\n(respondent no. 1 herein) pleaded not guilty and claimed trial.\n4. The  trial  court  in  N.D.P.S.  Special  Case  No.  133  of  2004\nconducted full-fledged trial which resulted in conviction of the\nrespondent no.1, for offences under Section 8(c), punishable\nunder Section 20(b)(ii)(c),  with rigorous imprisonment for 10\nyears and fine of  Rs.  1,00,000/- in default  to suffer  simple\nimprisonment for six months. Further, the respondent no. 1\nwas  sentenced  under  Section  28  read  with  Section  23  of\nN.D.P.S Act  to  undergo rigorous imprisonment for  10 years\nand  to  pay  fine  of  Rs.  1,00,000/-  and  in  default  to  suffer\nsimple  imprisonment  for  six  months.  Both  sentences  were\nordered to run concurrently. \n5. Aggrieved  by  the  order  of  conviction  of  the  trial  court,\nrespondent  no.  1  approached  the  High  Court  in  Criminal\n4\nAppeal No. 379 of 2007. The High Court by an order dated\n20.11.2008, acquitted the respondent no. 1 of all charges as,\nin  the  opinion of  the  High Court,  the  prosecution failed  in\nestablishing that the panchas were present during the seizure\nprocedure. The High Court while setting aside the trial court\norder  observed  that  the  trial  court  erred  in  convicting  the\nrespondent while relying on the sole evidence of PW-1 which is\nhighly inconsistent and full of contradictions.\n6. Aggrieved by the acquittal of respondent no. 1, Union of India\nhas preferred the present appeal before this court by way of\nspecial leave petition.  \n7. We  have  heard  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the\nappellant  –  Union  of  India  and  the  learned  senior  counsel\nappearing for respondent no.1.\n8. It  is  brought  to  our  notice  by  the  learned  senior  counsel\nappearing  for  respondent  no.1  that  his  client  has  already\nundergone four and a half  years of  incarceration and he is\nalso not in the country.\n9. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant – Union of India\naccepts the aforesaid statement.\n5\n10. Taking into consideration the evidence of PWs 8 and 9,\npanch  witnesses,  we  find  that  their  evidences  are\ncontradicting the statement of the Intelligence Officer (PW-1).\nWe may note that except the statement made under Section\n67 of the N.D.P.S. Act by respondent no.1, there is no other\nmaterial to substantiate the case against the said respondent.\nBoth PW-8 and PW-9 have categorically stated that, when they\nwere called by the Intelligence Officer (PW-1) and by the time\nthey  reached,  the  bag  was  already  opened.  Further  it  was\nadmitted by them that, the panchanama was not read over to\nthem. They were asked to sign on number of papers and they\nwere  not  aware  of  the  contents.  Moreover,  PW-1  i.e.,  the\nintelligence officer did not state that the bag containing the\nnarcotic substance was opened in the presence of panchas.\nThe cross-examination of  PW-9 clearly reveals that he does\nnot agree to the contents of the panchanama with respect to\nthe fact that the search and inspection of the baggage took\nplace  in  his  presence.  His  signatures  obtained  on  the\npanchanama were not voluntarily put, which is apparent from\n6\nthe  following  statements  made  by  PW-9  during  the\ncross-examination:\n“As I was Trainee and new person I did\nnot  want  to  hurt  the  custom  officer,\ntherefore  I  signed  panchanama  and\narticles without reading it.”\nMoreover,  aforesaid  conclusion  is  substantiated  by  the\nstatement  of  PW-8 made  in  the  examination-in-chief  in  the\nfollowing manner-\n“After  entering  the  office  room  of  AIU\nSection, I saw one open suitcase, number\nof officers were present and packets were\nshown  to  me…  I  signed  on  numbers  of\npapers  and  on  packets  being  shown  to\nme.”\n11. It is to be noted that the entire case of the prosecution\nhinges on the alleged recovery of the narcotic substance from\nrespondent  no.  1  but,  this  very  fact  is  not  proved  beyond\nreasonable doubt as independent witnesses PW-8 and PW-9\nhave portrayed a different story as to the recovery and seizure.\nIn the facts and circumstances of this case exclusive reliance\non the statement made by respondent no. 1 would neither be\nprudent  nor  safe;  especially  considering  the  fact  that,  the\n7\nstatement of respondent no. 1 procured under Section 67 of\nthe NDPS Act was retracted on 29.06.2004. \n12. After analysis of the above circumstances and evidences;\nprudence dictates that  the  statement of  the official  witness\nPW-1 cannot be the sole basis for convicting the respondent\nno.  1.  It  may be  noted that  when the  statement  of  official\nwitness is impaired due to infirmities, it is not safe to place\nreliance upon the same and pass conviction order against the\naccused.  In  the  present  case,  as  already  stated  above,  the\nstatements  of  the  independent  panch  witnesses  depict  a\ndifferent picture than the one portrayed by the official witness\nPW-1. \n13. We are of  the opinion that the High Court had rightly\nacquitted the respondent no.1 taking into consideration the\naforesaid aspects.\n14. In view of the above and having regard to the fact that\nthe incident is of the year 2004, we find no reason to interfere\n8\nwith the impugned order passed by the High Court.  In the\nresult, the appeal lacks merit and is dismissed.\n……….......................J.\n                                                            (N.V.

The order in favour of the appellant\nunder Section 125 Cr.P.C. granting maintenance at the\nrate  of  Rs.4000/-  per  month  from  the  month  of\nSeptember, 2013, has been set aside, mainly on the\nground that the appellant failed to prove that she\nwas the wife of respondent – Subudh Das.  According\nto the appellant, the respondent had fathered three\nchildren in her though the same was denied by the\nrespondent.\n  \n3. Hence, by order dated 28.02.2017, we directed the\nparties to go for a DNA test.  The report of the DNA\nhas been forwarded to us.

Leave granted.\n2. Out of the eight appeals before us, in five\nappeals  the  State  who  is  a  guarantor  to  the\nbonds, by which the borrower namely, Pradeshiya\n2\nIndustrial Development Corporation Ltd., UP (in\nshort, “PICUP”) collected money, is before this\nCourt, aggrieved by the Judgment dated 24.01.2012\npassed by the High Court of Allahabad, Lucknow\nBench,  in  W.P.(C)  No.  2838  (M/B)  of  2005  and\nconnected matter.  In other three appeals, PICUP\nis  before  this  Court,  aggrieved  by  the  same\nimpugned Judgment.\n3. Since the borrower failed to comply with the\nterms  of  the  bonds,  the  respondents  approached\nthe High Court for a direction to the State, the\nGuarantor, to comply with the terms of guarantee.\nAs per the impugned Judgment, the High Court held\nthat the State had guaranteed the payment as per\nthe terms of the bonds, but failed to honour the\nsame.  Accordingly, a direction was issued to the\nState  to  disburse  the  remaining  amounts  at\ncontractual rates.  It is pointed out that all\nthe  respondents  have  been  paid  the  principal\namounts.  Thus aggrieved, the State and the PICUP\nare before this Court in respective appeals.  \n4. Sh.  Pramod  Swarup,  learned  senior  counsel\nappearing for the State and Mr. M. C. Dingra,\n3\nlearned counsel appearing for PICUP, submit that\nthe writ petition filed by the respondents for\nenforcing  the  terms  of  the  contract  was  not\nmaintainable.  It is also submitted that 99% of\nthe  purchasers  of  the  bonds  had  settled  their\ndisputes with a reduced rate of interest.  It is\nalso submitted that, in any case, the respondents\nshould  have  sought  for  a  remedy  of\ninter-ministerial  meeting  and  settled  the\ndisputes in the meeting.\n5. Mr.  Sunil  Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel\nappearing for the respondents, submits that the\nrespondents have, in fact, suffered heavily, on\nmany counts and in some cases, on account of the\npre-mature termination of the bonds.  He has also\nbrought to our notice the order dated 15.10.2008\npassed by this Court in Civil Appeal No. 6126 of\n2008  titled  as  “State  of  U.P.  Vs.  Hindustan\nUnilevers Ltd. & Ors.” along with Civil Appeal\nNo. 6127 of 2008, in almost similar circumstances\nagainst the State.  Repelling all the contentions\ntaken  by  the  appellants,  some  of  which  are\nreferred  to  above,  this  Court  passed  the\nfollowing order in the above referred cases :-\n4\n“Leave  granted.  Heard  the  learned\ncounsel.\n2. The U.P. Cooperative Spinning Mills\nFederation  Ltd.  (hereinafter\n'Federation',  for  short)  invited\napplications for private placement of\ndebenture  bonds  in  the  year  1998\nrepresenting  that  the  repayment\nthereof  was  unconditionally  and\nirrevocably  guaranteed  by  the  U.P.\nGovernment.  The  State  Government\nissued  Government  Order  dated\n12.8.1998  guaranteeing  the  repayment\nof  the  principal  and  interest  in\nrespect of debenture bonds issued by\nthe  U.P.  Cooperative  Spinning  Mills\nFederation Ltd.\n3.  Acting  on  the  invitation  for\nprivate placement of applications, and\nin view of the guarantee by the State\nGovernment,  the  first  respondent\ninvested  Rs.15,00,000/-  (Rupees\nfifteen lakhs only) from the provident\nfund deposits of its employees, in the\nsaid bonds. The Federation issued an\nallotment  letter  dated  25.12.1998\nconfirming  that  the  amount  invested\nwill carry interest @ 14.9% p.a. and\nthe bonds will be redeemed at the end\nof 48 months, 54 months and 60 months\nat  the  rate  of  33%,  33%  and  34%\nrespectively.\n5\n4. The Federation sustained losses and\nwent  under  liquidation.  It  did  not\nredeem  the  bonds  as  agreed  and\nundertaken, in spite of demands. The\namounts due were not paid except part\npayment  of  Rs.1,73,980/-  and\nRs.1,15,118/-  in  all  Rs.2,89,098/-\ntowards interest. As the amounts due\nunder the bonds and interest were not\npaid by the State Government in terms\nof  guarantee,  inspite  of  demand  for\npayment, the respondent approached the\nDelhi High Court for relief. The High\nCourt,  by  order  dated  21.11.2005,\ndirected  the  State  Government,  as\nguarantor,  to  pay  the  sum  of\nRs.15,00,000/- (Rupees fifteen lakhs)\nwith  interest  at  the  rate  of  14.9%\n(the rate agreed under the bonds) less\namounts already paid. The said order\nis challenged in these two appeals by\nthe  State  Government  and  the\nFederation.\n5.  Though  several  contentions  were\nurged by the State Government and the\nFederation,  when  the  matter  came  up\ntoday,  the  learned  counsel  for  the\nState  Government  handed  over  a  Pay\nOrder  for  Rs.15,00,000/-  (Rupees\nfifteen lakhs) to the learned counsel\nfor respondent towards the refund of\nthe principal amount. In regard to\n6\ninterest, the learned counsel for the\nFederation  and  the  State  Government\nsubmitted  that  as  the  Federation  is\nunder  liquidation  and  as  the  State\nGovernment  has  paid  the  principal\namount,  the  respondent  should  be\nrelegated to other remedies in law for\nrecovery of interest.\n6. Such a contention is not tenable.\nThe  amount  invested  by  first\nrespondent belongs to the workmen of\nfirst  respondent.  The  amount  was\ninvested  in  the  bonds  of  the\nFederation  in  view  of  the  express\nguarantee by the State Government that\nthe same will be repaid with interest\nupto  15.5% p.a.  The very  purpose of\nthe State Government guarantee is to\nensure payment in case the Federation\nwas not able to make payment. In the\ncircumstances,  the  fact  that  the\nFederation  is  in  financial\ndifficulties  cannot  be  a  ground  for\nthe  State Government  to say  that it\nwill  not  make  payment  of  interest,\neven  though  it  had  guaranteed  the\nrepayment  with  interest.  If  such  a\ncontention  is  accepted,  the  very\npurpose  of  the  guarantee  will  be\ndefeated. We are indeed surprised that\nsuch a plea is put forward on behalf\nof the State of Uttar Pradesh.\n7\n7. In the circumstances, we are of the\nview that the State Government should\npay the interest also. However, on the\nfacts and circumstances, we are of the\nview that interest should be paid at\nthe rate of 14.9% p.a. for a period of\nfive  years from  the date  of deposit\nand thereafter at the rate of 9.5% per\nannum (which is equal to the minimum\nrate  of interest  that is  payable by\nthe first respondent to its workers on\nthe  provident  fund  dues).  The  above\nconcession  regarding  interest  is\ngranted on the peculiar facts of these\nappeals. Three months' time is granted\nto the Government of Uttar Pradesh to\npay the balance of interest.\n8.  Appeals  are  disposed  of\naccordingly.  Parties  to  bear  their\nrespective costs.”\n6. Having regard to the submissions made by the\nlearned counsel on both sides, we are of the view\nthat  as  in  the  case  of  State  Vs.  Hindustan\nUnilevers (supra), this is also a fit case where\nthis  Court  should  invoke  its  discretion  under\nArticle 142 of the Constitution of India to do\ncomplete justice between the parties and to put\nan end to the entire litigations.  Accordingly,\nin  the  peculiar  facts  of  these  cases,  these\n8\nappeals are disposed of as follows :-\ni) The  respondents  shall  be  entitled  to  the\ncontractual rate of interest as per the bonds,\ntill the principal amounts were repaid.\nii) From that date, the respondents shall be paid\ninterest at the rate of 11%.\niii) The payment shall be made positively within\na period of three months from today.\niv) In case the payments are not made within the\nstipulated  period,  the  respondents  shall  be\nentitled to interest at the rate of 18% and the\nofficer(s)  responsible  for  the  delay  will  be\npersonally liable for the same.  \nNo costs. \n.......................J.\n              [ KURIAN JOSEPH ] \n.......................J.\n              [ MOHAN M.

Petitioner  \nVersus \n \n \nProf. R.C. Deka, Director,  \nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences                 ...    Respondent  \n \n \nJ U D G M E N T \n \nMadan B. Lokur, J. \n \n1. The petitioner who appears in person was initially engaged on a \ncontract basis as a Technical Assistant (ENT) in the All India Institute of \nMedical Sciences in 1998.  The initial contract was for a period of three \nmonths, but it was renewed from time to time, without any artificial \nbreaks, on a quarterly or a six monthly basis.  It appears that the services \nof the petitioner were taken on contract basis without following any laid \ndown procedure and without adherence to any rules.  The contract of the \npetitioner was finally extended from  1\nst\n January, 2010 to 30\nth\n June, 2010.  \n2. When the contract of the petitioner was not renewed after 30\nth\n \nJune, 2010 he approached the Principal Bench of the Central \nAdministrative Tribunal by filing OA No. 4104 of 2010. The OA was \n       \n S.L.P. (C) Nos. 22475-22476 of 2012                                                                                           Page 2 of 5 \n \n \nsubsequently amended, but the essential prayer of the petitioner was to \nthe effect that the order dated 24\nth\n November, 2010 passed by the All \nIndia Institute of Medical Sciences, declining to extend his contract ad \nhoc appointment by a further period of six months ought to be quashed. \n3. By its judgement and order dated 25\nth\n July, 2011 the Central \nAdministrative Tribunal declined to grant this relief to the petitioner on \nthe ground that he had no right to an extension of his services and further, \nhe had no right to be regularised as a Technical Assistant since his \nappointment on a contractual basis or on an ad hoc basis was made \nwithout following any laid down procedure and without following any \nrules. In this regard, the Central Administrative Tribunal relied upon the \ndecision of this Court in Secretary, State of Karnataka v. Uma Devi (3)\n1\n  \nThe OA was accordingly dismissed. \n4. Feeling aggrieved by the decision of the Central Administrative \nTribunal, the petitioner preferred a review petition, but that too was \ndismissed. Eventually, the petitioner preferred a writ petition in the Delhi \nHigh Court being W.P. (C) No. 7870 of 2011.  The High Court passed a \nbrief order recording that reliance placed by the Central Administrative \nTribunal on the decision of this Court in Uma Devi was correct.  It was \nalso recorded that the learned counsel for the All India Institute of \n                                                          \n1\n (2006) 4 SCC 1 \n       \n S.L.P. (C) Nos. 22475-22476 of 2012                                                                                           Page 3 of 5 \n \n \nMedical Sciences had stated that no contract employee in the ENT \nDepartment had been granted an extension after 1\nst\n January, 2009.  In \nthese circumstances the High Court dismissed the writ petition of the \npetitioner by its order dated 19\nth\n December, 2011.  The petitioner \npreferred a review petition in the High Court, but that too was dismissed \nby an order dated 24\nth\n January, 2012.  In the circumstances, the petitioner \nhas preferred the present petition. \n5. We heard the petitioner, appearing in person, on 17\nth\n January, \n2018.     He submitted that there was no reason why his services were not \nextended. Even though he had received a favourable recommendation for \nthe continuance of his services.   He contended that the decision of the \nAll India Institute of Medical Sciences in not renewing his contract was \narbitrary and unjustified.  The petitioner also drew our attention to a \ncommunication dated   22\nnd\n February, 2017 received by him from the All \nIndia Institute of Medical Sciences in response to a query made by him \nunder the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005.   In the \ncommunication, it was acknowledged that in May 2016 three persons \nwere appointed to the post of Technical Assistant (ENT) after a walk-in \ninterview. The contention of the petitioner was that under the \ncircumstances, it was clear that the All India Institute of Medical Sciences \n       \n S.L.P. (C) Nos. 22475-22476 of 2012                                                                                           Page 4 of 5 \n \n \nneeded the services of Technical Assistants and therefore there was no \nreason why his services were not extended. \n6. It is settled law that no contract employee has a right to have his or \nher contract renewed from time to time.  That being so, we are in \nagreement with the Central Administrative Tribunal and the High Court \nthat the petitioner was unable to show any statutory or other right to have \nhis contract extended beyond 30\nth\n June, 2010. At best, the petitioner could \nclaim that the concerned authorities should consider extending his \ncontract. We find that in fact due consideration was given to this and in \nspite of a favourable recommendation having been made, the All India \nInstitute of Medical Sciences did not find it appropriate or necessary to \ncontinue with his services on a contractual basis. We do not find any \narbitrariness in the view taken by the concerned authorities and therefore \nreject this contention of the petitioner. \n7. We are also in agreement with the view expressed by the Central \nAdministrative Tribunal and the High Court that the petitioner is not \nentitled to the benefit of the decision of this Court in Uma Devi.  There is \nnothing on record to indicate that the appointment of the petitioner on a \ncontractual basis or on an ad hoc basis was made in accordance with any \nregular procedure or by following the necessary rules. That being so, no \nright accrues in favour of the petitioner for regularisation of his services. \n       \n S.L.P. (C) Nos. 22475-22476 of 2012                                                                                           Page 5 of 5 \n \n \nThe decision in Uma Devi does not advance the case of the petitioner. \n8. Insofar as the final submission of the petitioner to the effect that \nsome persons were appointed as Technical Assistant (ENT) in May 2016 \nis concerned, we are of the view that the events of 2016 cannot relate \nback to the events of 2010 when a decision was taken by the All India \nInstitute of Medical Sciences not to extend the contract of the petitioner. \nThe situation appears to have changed over the last six years and the \npetitioner cannot take any advantage of the changed situation. There is no \nmaterial on record to indicate what caused the change in circumstances, \nand merely because there was a change in circumstances, does not mean \nthat the petitioner is entitled to any benefit.  On the other hand, it might \nhave been more appropriate for the petitioner to have participated in the \nwalk-in interview so that he could also be considered for appointment as \nTechnical Assistant (ENT), but he chose not to do so. \n9. We find no merit in these petitions and they are accordingly \ndismissed. \n \n………………………J \n      (Madan B.

All these appeals raising only above question of law have\n3\nbeen   heard   together   and   are   being   decided   by   this   common\njudgment.   For   deciding   all   these   appeals,   it   shall   be\nsufficient to refer facts and proceedings in Civil Appeal No.\n2165 of 2012.\nFACTS\nCivil Appeal No. 2165 of 2012\n4. This appeal has been filed against the judgment of Bombay\nHigh Court dated 12.09.2011 in Income Tax Appeal (L) No. 947\nof 2011 by which judgment the High Court has dismissed the\nappeal filed by the Commissioner of Income Tax following an\nearlier judgment of the Bombay High Court dated 12.08.2010 in\nthe case of  Godrej Boyce and Manufacturing Company Limited\nVs.   Deputy   Commissioner   of   Income   Tax,   Mumbai   &   Anr.,\nreported in (2010) 328 ITR 81(Bom.).   The assessment year in\nissue is 2003­2004.  The assessee (respondent in appeal) filed\nhis   return   of   income   on   01.12.2003   declaring   a   loss   of\nRs.69,92,67,527/­.  A notice under Section 143(2) was issued\nto the assessee.  The Assessing Officer vide its order dated\n27.03.2006 held that during the year under consideration, the\nassessee   company   was   in   receipt   of   both   taxable   and\nnon­taxable dividend  income.   Accordingly,  the  dividend on\ninvestment exempt under Section 10(23G) was considered by the\nA.O.   for   the   purpose   of   disallowance   U/S.14A.     Hence,\n4\nproportionate   interest   relating   to   investment   on   which\nexemption   u/s.10(23G)   is   available   as   per   the   working\namounting   to   Rs.26   crores   was   disallowed   U/S.14A   r.w.s.\n10(23G) of the I.T. Act.   \n5. The assessee filed an appeal, which was partly allowed by\norder dated 05.03.2009.  The assessee filed an appeal before\nthe ITAT.  The ITAT allowed the assessee’s appeal relying on\nthe   Bombay   High   Court’s   judgment   in  Godrej   and   Boyce\nManufacturing Company Limited versus Deputy Commissioner of\nIncome Tax, Mumabi & Another., reported in (2010) 328 ITR\n81(Bom.).  The ITAT held that Rule 8D is only prospective and\nin the year under consideration Rule 8D was not applicable.\nITAT set aside the order of CIT(A) and restored the issue back\nto the file of the Assessing Officer for de novo adjudication\nwithout invoking the provisions of Rule 8D.  Against the order\nof ITAT, the revenue filed an appeal before the High Court.\nThe High Court following its earlier judgment of  Godrej and\nBoyce Manufacturing Company Limited Vs. Deputy Commissioner\nof Income Tax, Mumbai & Anr. (supra)  dismissed the appeal.\nThe Commissioner of Income Tax aggrieved by the judgment of\nthe High Court has come up in this appeal. \n6. In the appeal, the only question, which has been pressed\n5\nfor our consideration is the first question, which was raised\nbefore the High Court, which is to the following effect:­\n“Whether on the facts and circumstance of the case\nand in law, the Hon’ble ITAT is right in holding\nthat applicability of Rule 8D is only prospective\nin operation and for the year under assessment it\nwas not applicable?”\n7. Thus, in this batch of appeals, the only question to be\nconsidered and answered is as to whether Rule 8D of Income Tax\nRules is prospective in operation as held by the High Court or\nit is retrospective in operation and shall also be applicable\nin the assessment year in question as contended by learned\ncounsel for the revenue.\n8. We   have   heard   Shri   Yashank   Adhyaru,   learned   senior\ncounsel, Shri Arijit Prasad, learned counsel for the appellant\nShri S.K. Bagaria, learned senior counsel, Shri Ajay Vohra,\nlearned senior counsel and other learned counsel have been\nheard for different assessees in this batch of appeals. \n“SUBMISSIONS”\n9. Learned counsel for the appellant (revenue) submit that\nprovisions of Section 14A being clarificatory in nature and\nRule   8D   is   a   procedural   provision   which   provided   only   a\nmachinery for the implementation of sub­sections (2) and (3),\nRule 8D is retrospective in nature.  The machinery provisions\n6\nby which the charging section is to be implemented or workable\nare to be given retrospective effect, which is co­terminus\nwith the period of operation of the main charging provision.\nThe   charging   section   i.e.   Section   14A   admittedly   being\nretrospective, the machinery provision, i.e. Rule 8D has also\nto be retrospective.  \n10. Learned counsel for the revenue has placed reliance on\njudgments of this Court, i.e.,  Commissioner of Wealth Tax,\nMeerut Vs. Sharvan Kumar Swarup & Sons, (1994) 6 SCC 623;\nCommissioner of Income Tax I, Ahmedabad Vs. Gold Coin Health\nFood Private Limited, (2008) 9 SCC 622 and Commissioner of\nIncome Tax – III Vs. Calcutta Knitwears, Ludhiana, (2014) 6\nSCC 444.\n11. Shri S.K. Bagaria, learned senior counsel appearing for\nthe assessee refuting the submission of learned counsel for\nthe   revenue   contends   that   provisions   of   Rule   8D   are   only\nprospective in nature.",

These two appeals have been filed against the judgment of\nHigh   Court   of   judicature   at   Allahabad   (Lucknow   Bench),\nLucknow, dated 04.10.2010 dismissing the Special Appeal No.446\nof 2006 of the appellant as well as judgment dated 20.12.2012\ndismissing   the   review   application   filed   by   the   appellant.\nParties shall be referred to as referred in the appeal.\n2. Brief facts of the case giving rise to these appeals are:\nThe appellant belongs to other backward caste who has\npassed graduation (B.A.) with Psychology and has also done\n2\npost­graduation   in   Psychology   from   Kanpur   University.\nAppellant has also obtained master degree in Human Resource\nManagement and Industrial Relations from Lucknow University in\nthe year 1997. An advertisement dated 30.08.2001 was issued by\nthe   Director,   Social   Welfare   Department,   U.P.,   advertising\nvarious posts under Director, Social Welfare Department and\nother   department   of   State.   Advertisement   also   contained\nrecruitment for post of Psychologist (03 posts). The appellant\nsubmitted the application for the post of ‘Psychologist’. The\nappellant was issued admit card for appearing in the written\nexamination. The appellant appeared in the written examination\nand was declared successful and included in the merit list. A\nletter dated 02.05.2003 was issued to the appellant asking the\nappellant   to   appear   along   with   original   certificates   for\nverification of documents. The appellant appeared along with\nall the documents on 12.05.2003. When appellant appeared on\n12th  May, he was informed that he is not eligible and his\nappointment for the post of ‘Psychologist’ cannot be made. The\nappellant   submitted   a   representation   on   02.06.2003   to   the\nrespondent. The appellant having not been given appointment;\nhence, he filed a writ petition praying for the following\nrelief:\n“ PRAYER\n3\n(I) issue a writ order or  direction  \nincluding a  writ   in   the   nature  \nof  mandamus   commanding   the  \nopposite parties to appoint  the  \npetitioner on the post  of  \nPsychologist for which  the  \npetitioner is fully  eligible   and  \nqualified as  per   advertisement  \npublished  for direct recruitment  \nin SAMOOH 'GA'.\n(II) Issue a writ order or  direction  \nincluding a  writ   in   the   nature  \nof  mandamus   commanding   the  \nopposite not to appoint any  other\ncandidature on the  post   of  \nPsychologist for  which   the  \npetitioner is  fully eligible.\n(III)Issue a writ order or  direction  \nincluding a  writ   in   the   nature  \nof  mandamus   commanding   the  \nopposite parties not to  harass  \nand victimize the petitioner   in  \nany  manner whatsoever.\n(IV) Issue such other order/orders as may\ndeem just and proper by this Hon'ble\nCourt   in   the   Circumstances   of   the\ncase.\n(V) Award the cost of petition  in   favour\nof the  petitioner.”\n3. In the writ petition, learned single Judge directed for\nfiling a counter affidavit and also bringing on record the\ncopy   of   the   Order   passed   on   the   representation   of   the\nappellant   dated   02.06.2003.   The   appellant   also   filed   a\nContempt Application No.182 of 2004 in which Director, Social\nWelfare   was   directed   to   appear   in   person.   An   Order   dated\n4\n19.04.2004   was   passed   by   the   respondent   rejecting   the\nrepresentation   of   the   appellant.   The   appellant   prayed   for\namendment of the writ petition, praying for quashing the order\ndated 19.04.2004 which prayer was allowed to be added. Learned\nsingle Judge by its judgment dated 18.05.2006 dismissed the\nwrit petition. Learned single Judge accepted the case taken up\nby the respondent in the counter affidavit that appellant is\nnot qualified for the post since he does not have training\nqualification i.e. L.T./B.T.B.Ed. The appellant filed special\nappeal   which   too   was   dismissed.   Review   application   filed\nthereafter was also rejected.\n4.  We heard Shri Mukesh K. Giri, learned counsel for the\nappellant   and   Shri   Ajay   Kumar   Mishra,   Additional   Advocate\nGeneral, appearing for the State of U.P.\n5. Learned   counsel   for   the   appellant   submits   that   the\nappellant being graduate and post­graduate in ‘Psychology’ was\nfully eligible for the post of ‘Psychologist’. It is submitted\nthat   the   advertisement   has   been   wrongly   read   by   the   High\nCourt. Graduate in Psychology was qualified for the post and\nadvertisement   does   not   prescribe   qualification   as   graduate\nwith Psychology and L.T./B.T. B.Ed. He further submits that\nalthough   the   post   of   Psychologist   in   the   Social   Welfare\nDepartment was declared as dead cadre by the Government Order\n5\ndated 09.05.2008 but said posts were again revised by the\nsubsequent Government Order dated 17.08.2010. He submits that\npost of Psychologist is not a teaching post; hence, it was not\nnecessary to have training qualification. Learned counsel has\nalso relied on the rules namely Janjatiya Vikas Shikshan Aur\nKermchariverg Sewa Niyamawali, 1991, according to which, he\nsubmits that for Psychologist, training qualification is not\nessential qualification and as per rule minimum qualification\nis M.A. in Psychology. B.Ed. is only preferable qualification.\nHe submits that the essential work of the Psychologist was to\nprovide   educational   counseling   to   the   students   and   other\nduties and was not essentially a teaching post. He submits\nthat  the  advertisement  mentioned,  in  subject  of Psychology\nGraduate or L.T./B.T. B.Ed.\n6.   Shri   Ajay   Kumar   Mishra,   Additional   Advocate   General,\nrefuting the submissions of learned counsel for the appellant\ncontends that respondents have rightly held the appellant not\nqualified.   He   submits   that   according   to   advertisement\nessential   qualification   is   graduate   in   Psychology   with\nL.T./B.T.B.Ed. He submits that Janjatiya Vikas Shikshan Aur\nKermchariverg Sewa Niyamawali, 1991, hereinafter referred to\nas 1991 Rules governed the fields.  It is, however, submitted\nthat   although   appellant   was   called   to   appear   in   written\n6\nexamination and interview but on discovering that he is not\neligible as per the requirement of the recruitment rule, the\nrespondent corrected the mistake on their part by not going\nany further with the appointment of the appellant by rejecting\nhis candidature.\n7. We have considered the submissions of the learned counsel\nfor the parties and perused the record.\n8. The parties are at variance with regard to correct import\nof the advertisement. The appellant’s case was that as per the\nadvertisement  the  graduation  in Psychology  was  the  minimum\nqualification   and   qualification   of   L.T./B.T.   B.Ed.   were\nindependent qualification on fulfilling of which candidate was\nqualified.   Advertisement   does   not   require   graduate   with\nPsychology with L.T./B.T. B.Ed. to make candidate eligible.\nWhereas the respondent’s case is that the candidate shall be\nqualified only when he is both graduate with Psychology and\npossesses L.T./B.T. B.Ed. The case of the respondent is that\nalthough the appellant was issued admit card and called to\nappear in the written and in interview but his appointment was\nnot   issued   since   it   was   realized   that   he   does   not   have\nL.T./B.T. B.Ed. qualification.   In paragraph 4(Xiii) of the\ncounter affidavit it has been reiterated that even if there is\nsome ambiguity in the advertisement, the appointment has to be\n7\nmade as per the recruitment rules which in this case is 1991\nRules.   It   is   useful   to   extract   following   as   stated   in\nparagraph 4(Xiii) of the counter affidavit",

MURUGAN                                Appellant(s)\n                                VERSUS\nTHE CHAIRMAN NAVODAYA VIDYALAYA \nSAMITI AND ORS.   Respondent(s)\nJ U D G M E N T\nKURIAN, J.\n1. The  appellant  is  before  this  Court\nchallenging the order dated 13.06.2008 passed by\nthe High Court of Judicature at Madras in W.P.\nNo. 38815 of 2006.\n2. The  appellant  had  approached  the  Central\nAdministrative  Tribunal  (in  short,  “CAT”)\nchallenging  his  termination  by  the  respondent\ndated  13.06.2003.   The  appellant  started  his\nservice in 05.06.1989 as a Teacher in Navodaya\nVidyalaya  School.   In  1998,  he  became  the\nVice-Principal of the school.  From 2001 onwards,\nhe was serving as the Principal of the school.\n3. On  allegations  pertaining  to  sexual\nharassment of a student of Class X, he was put\nunder  suspension  on  18.12.2002  and  after\n2\nconducting  an  inquiry  by  a  three-Member\nCommittee, he was dismissed from service by an\norder dated 13.06.2003.  The CAT set aside the\norder of termination and directed reinstatement\nof the appellant with back wages.  That order was\nchallenged  by  the  respondent  before  the  High\nCourt.  The High Court set aside the order passed\nby the CAT and upheld the order of termination.\nThus  aggrieved,  the  appellant  is  before  this\nCourt by way of special leave.\n4. We have heard the learned counsel appearing\nfor the appellant as well as the learned counsel\nappearing  for  the  respondent  extensively.   We\nhave also gone through the records.  We do not\nthink it necessary to refer to the factual matrix\nin  detail.   However,  we  deem  it  necessary  to\nrefer  to  one  main  contention  raised  by  the\nappellant that his entry to the premises of the\nstudent was in the company of a Chaukidar of the\nSchool and that too, on getting an information\nthat  the  student  was  not  appearing  for  the\nexamination. The allegation is that the appellant\ntried to sexually harass the student.  The Deputy\nDirector held against the appellant and so also\n3\nby  the  three-Member  Committee.   However,  the\nDistrict Collector ordered a Magisterial Inquiry\nand  in  that  inquiry,  the  appellant  has  been\ncompletely exonerated.\n5. Whether  we  should  rely  on  the  Magisterial\nInquiry or the Inquiry held by the three-Member\nCommittee is one issue, but the fact remains that\nthe  regular  inquiry  under  the  CCS\n(Classification, Control and Appeal) Rules, 1965\nwas dispensed with.  We would also like to take\nnote  of  one  special  factual  position  that  the\nstudent  has,  in  fact,  appeared  for  the\nexamination  after  the  alleged  incident.   The\nappellant has a serious grievance that he was not\nserved a copy of the report of the three-Member\nCommittee  and,  therefore,  he  did  not  get  an\nopportunity to challenge the same.  These aspects\nhave been discussed at length by the CAT.\n6. The High Court, it appears, has taken note of\nthe report prepared by the Deputy Director and\nhas  placed  heavy  reliance  on  that.   But\nunfortunately,  the  allegation  raised  by  the\nappellant that the wife of the Deputy Director\nwas a teacher in a different school under the\n4\nNavodaya  Vidyalaya  Samiti  and  that  the  Deputy\nDirector had some motive against the appellant,\nwhich  he  stated  in  the  inquiry  before  the\nCommittee, has not been noticed.  \n7. We are informed that the appellant is due to\nretire on 12.02.2018.  We are also informed that\nthere  is  no  Regular  Pension  Scheme  under  the\nNavodaya Vidyalaya Samiti.  Though it would have\nbeen a case where we should have set aside the\nwhole  proceedings  and  directed  the  competent\nauthority to start from the stage of furnishing a\ncopy  of  the  inquiry  report  and  give  an\nopportunity  for  objections  and  thereafter,\nhearing etc., having regard to the fact that the\nappellant is otherwise due to superannuate from\nservice in the next month, we are of the view\nthat  this  Court  should  invoke  its  jurisdiction\nunder Article 142 of the Constitution of India\nand  give  a  quietus  to  the  whole  litigation\nbetween the parties, respecting the dignity and\nprotecting the rights of all the parties.\n8. Accordingly this appeal is disposed of with\nthe following directions :-\n5\ni) On the date of termination i.e. 13.06.2003,\nthe appellant shall be deemed to have voluntarily\nretired from service.\nii) Till such time, the appellant shall be deemed\nto be in service for all purposes.  The benefits\narising from such service upto 13.06.2003 shall\nbe  worked  out  and  paid  to  him  with  simple\ninterest  at  the  rate  of  6%  per  annum  upto\n13.06.2003 within a period of three months from\ntoday.\niii) In order to work out the relief as above,\nthe Judgment under appeal and the other impugned\norders shall stand set aside.\n9. We make it clear that this Judgment is passed\nin the peculiar facts and circumstances of this\ncase and shall not be treated as a precedent.\nNo costs. \n.......................J.\n              [ KURIAN JOSEPH ] \n.......................J.\n              [ MOHAN M.

The  present  appeal  assails  an  interim  order  dated\n24.04.2015 passed in a writ petition under Article 226 of the\nConstitution,  staying  further  proceedings  at  the  stage  of\nSection  13(4)  of  the  Securitisation  and  Reconstruction  of\nFinancial  Assets  and  Enforcement  of  Security  Interest  Act,\n2002 (hereinafter referred as the ‘SARFAESI Act’), on deposit of\n1\nRs.3,50,000/-within two weeks.  An appeal against the same\nhas also been dismissed by the Division Bench observing that\ncounter affidavit having been filed, it would be open for the\nAppellant Bank to seek clarification/modification/variation of\nthe interim order.\n3. Shri H.P. Raval, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\nAppellants, submits that the loan account of the Respondent\nwas  declared  a  Non-Performing  Asset  (NPA)  on  28.12.2014.\nThe outstanding dues of the Respondent on the date of  the\ninstitution  of  the  writ  petition  was  Rs.41,82,560/-.  Despite\nrepeated notices, the Respondent failed and neglected to pay\nthe  dues.  Statutory  notice  under  Section  13(2)  of  the\nSARFAESI Act was issued to the Respondent on 21.01.2015.\nThe  objections  under  Section  13(3A)  were  considered,  and\nrejection was communicated by the Appellant on 31.3.2015.\nPossession notice was then issued under Section 13(4) of the\nAct read with Rule 8 of  The Security Interest (Enforcement)\n2\nRules,  2002  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  ‘the  Rules’)  on\n21.04.2015.  \n4.  The SARFAESI Act is a complete code by itself, providing\nfor expeditious recovery of dues arising out of loans granted by\nfinancial institutions, the remedy of appeal by the aggrieved\nunder Section 17 before the Debt Recovery Tribunal, followed\nby  a  right  to  appeal  before  the  Appellate  Tribunal  under\nSection 18.  The High Court ought not to have entertained the\nwrit  petition  in  view  of  the  adequate  alternate  statutory\nremedies available to the Respondent.  The interim order was\npassed on the very first date, without an opportunity to the\nAppellant to file a reply.  Reliance was placed on United Bank\nof India vs. Satyawati Tandon and others, 2010 (8) SCC\n110, and  General Manager, Sri Siddeshwara Cooperative\nBank Limited and another vs. Ikbal and others, 2013 (10)\nSCC 83.  The writ petition ought to have been dismissed at the\nthreshold  on  the  ground  of  maintainability.   The  Division\nBench erred in declining to interfere with the same. \n3\n5. Shri Roy Abraham, learned Counsel for the Respondent,\nsubmitted that it was desirous to repay the loan, and merely\nsought  regularisation of  the  loan account.   The inability  to\nservice  the  loan  was  genuine,  occasioned  due  to  market\nfluctuations causing huge loss in business, beyond the control\nof the Respondent.  The failure of the Bank to consider the\nrequest for regularisation of the loan account, the absence of a\nright  to  appeal  under  Section  17  against  the  order  passed\nunder Section 13(3A), the Respondent was left with no option\nbut to prefer the writ application as the Respondent genuinely\ndesired to discharge the loans.  The collateral security offered\nincluded  agricultural  lands  also,  which had  to  be  excluded\nunder  Section  31  of  the  SARFAESI  Act.  There  had  been\nviolation of the principles of natural justice.  A large number of\nsimilar  writ  applications are  pending before  the  High Court\npreferred  by  the  concerned  borrowers,  but  the  Bank  has\nsingled out the present Respondent alone for a challenge.\n4\n6. We  have  considered  the  submissions  on  behalf  of  the\nparties.  Normally this Court in exercise of jurisdiction under\nArticle 136 of the Constitution is loathe to interfere with an\ninterim order passed in a pending proceeding before the High\nCourt,  except  in  special  circumstances,  to  prevent  manifest\ninjustice or abuse of the process of the court.  In the present\ncase,  the  facts  are  not  in  dispute.   The  discretionary\njurisdiction under Article 226 is not absolute but has to be\nexercised  judiciously  in  the  given  facts  of  a  case  and  in\naccordance with law. The normal rule is that a writ petition\nunder  Article  226  of  the  Constitution  ought  not  to  be\nentertained  if  alternate  statutory  remedies  are  available,\nexcept in cases falling within the well  defined exceptions as\nobserved in  Commissioner of Income Tax and Others vs.\nChhabil Dass Agarwal, 2014 (1) SCC 603, as follows:\n“15. Thus, while it can be said that this Court\nhas recognised some exceptions to the rule of\nalternative  remedy  i.e.  where  the  statutory\nauthority has not acted in accordance with the\nprovisions of the enactment in question, or in\ndefiance  of  the  fundamental  principles  of\njudicial  procedure,  or  has resorted to  invoke\nthe provisions which are repealed, or when an\n5\norder has been passed in total violation of the\nprinciples  of  natural  justice,  the  proposition\nlaid  down  in  Thansingh  Nathmal  case,\nTitaghur  Paper  Mills  case  and  other  similar\njudgments  that  the  High  Court  will  not\nentertain  a  petition  under  Article  226 of  the\nConstitution if an effective alternative remedy\nis  available  to  the  aggrieved  person  or  the\nstatute under which the action complained of\nhas been taken itself contains a mechanism for\nredressal  of  grievance  still  holds  the  field.\nTherefore,  when a statutory forum is created\nby  law  for  redressal  of  grievances,  a  writ\npetition should not be entertained ignoring the\nstatutory dispensation.”\n7. The  pleadings  in  the  writ  petition  are  very  bald  and\ncontain no statement that the grievances fell within any of the\nwell  defined  exceptions.  The  allegation  for  violation  of\nprinciples of natural justice is rhetorical, without any details\nand the prejudice caused thereby.  It harps only on a desire\nfor  regularisation  of  the  loan  account,  even  while  the\nRespondent acknowledges its own inability to service the loan\naccount for reasons attributable to it alone.  The writ petition\nwas  filed  in  undue  haste  in  March  2015  immediately  after\ndisposal  of  objections under Section 13(3A).   The legislative\nscheme, in order to expedite the recovery proceedings, does\n6\nnot envisage grievance redressal  procedure at this stage, by\nvirtue of the explanation added to Section 17 of the Act, by\nAmendment Act 30 of 2004, as follows :-\n“Explanation.—For the removal  of  doubts, it\nis hereby declared that the communication of\nthe  reasons  to  the  borrower  by  the  secured\ncreditor  for  not  having  accepted  his\nrepresentation or objection or the likely action\nof  the  secured  creditor  at  the  stage  of\ncommunication  of  reasons  to  the  borrower\nshall  not  entitle  the  person  (including  the\nborrower) to make an application to the Debts\nRecovery Tribunal under this sub-section.”\n8. The  Section  13(4)  notice  along  with  possession  notice\nunder Rule 8 was issued on 21.04.2015.  The remedy under\nSection  17  of  the  SARFAESI  Act  was  now  available  to  the\nRespondent  if  aggrieved.   These  developments  were  not\nbrought  on  record  or  placed  before  the  Court  when  the\nimpugned interim order  came to  be  passed  on 24.04.2015.\nThe  writ  petition  was  clearly  not  instituted  bonafide,  but\npatently  to  stall  further  action  for  recovery.   There  is  no\npleading why the remedy available under Section 17 of the Act\nbefore the Debt Recovery Tribunal was not efficacious and the\n7\ncompelling  reasons  for  by-passing  the  same.  Unfortunately,\nthe High Court also did not dwell upon the same or record any\nspecial  reasons  for  grant  of  interim  relief  by  direction  to\ndeposit.\n9. The statement of objects and reasons of the SARFAESI\nAct states that the banking and financial sector in the country\nwas felt not to have a level playing field in comparison to other\nparticipants  in  the  financial  markets  in  the  world.  The\nfinancial institutions in India did not have the power to take\npossession  of  securities  and  sell  them.  The  existing  legal\nframework relating to commercial transactions had not kept\npace with changing commercial practices and financial sector\nreforms  resulting  in  tardy  recovery  of  defaulting  loans  and\nmounting  non-performing  assets  of  banks  and  financial\ninstitutions.  The Narasimhan Committee I and II as also the\nAndhyarujina  Committee  constituted  by  the  Central\nGovernment Act had suggested enactment of new legislation\nfor  securitisation  and  empowering  banks  and  financial\n8\ninstitutions  to  take  possession  of  securities  and  sell  them\nwithout court intervention which would enable them to realise\nlong term assets, manage problems of liquidity, asset liability\nmismatches and improve recovery.",

RAMANA, J.\n1. These five appeals, by way of special leave petitions, are by\nfive accused persons against the conviction imposed by the\nHigh Court, wherein leave to appeal to this court has been\ngranted to these accused. Facts being related, and the issue\ninvolved being connected, we would like to deal with these\ncases by a common judgment.\n2. At the outset, it is to be noted that the High Court has partly\nallowed the appeal preferred by the accused/appellants and\nset  aside their  sentence  for  the offences punishable  under\n3\nSections 143, 144, 147 and 148 of IPC, Section 4 read with\nSection 25 of the Arms Act and Section 37(1)(a) read with 135\nof the Bombay Police Act. The conviction of Appellant Nos. 1\nto 3 for the offence punishable under Section 302 read with\n149 of the IPC was modified to Section 302 read with 34 of\nIPC,  while  maintaining   the   sentence   imposed  by   the   trial\ncourt.\n3. A few facts which are necessary for disposal of these cases\nare that on the 10th of December, 2006 between 10:20 pm to\n10:30   pm,   one   Vitthal   Hingane   (PW­2)   and   his   brother\nJagdish Hingane (deceased) were returning from the office of\none Uttam Gite,  a  worker  of  a  political  party,  at  Mulund.\nWhen   they   reached   the   Saint   Pius   Lane,   six   persons   i.e.\nAccused No. 1  (Sunil  Chandanshiva),  Accused No. 2 (Vijay\nNirmal),   Accused   No.   3   (Latesh   Karlekar),   Accused   No.   4\n(Sandeep Bhosale), Accused No. 5 (Vishnu Bule) and Accused\nNo. 6 (Anil Gadekar) confronted them from the opposite side.\nThe   accused,  who  were   armed  with   various  weapons   like\nchopper,   sword,   sickle  and  stick,  on  account  of   some  old\nenmity,  assaulted  Jagdish Hingane   (deceased)  and  injured\nVitthal  Hingane  (PW­2).  Hearing   the  shouts  of   the   injured\n4\nand the deceased, PW­11  (Police  Naik,  Dyaneshwar Ladse)\nand Police Naik Ghyansham Pawar (not examined), who were\non   patrol   duty,   rushed   to   their   help.   It   is   alleged   that\nAccused No.  1  was  caught   red­handed with  blood  stained\nchopper   in   his   hand   but   the   other   accused   persons\nsucceeded in fleeing from the spot. An independent witness,\nPW­16 (Kishore Potdar), who was passing through the same\nroad, upon hearing the shouts, also came to the help of PW­\n11.  The  injured  (PW 2)  was taken  in an auto­rickshaw to\nMulund General Hospital while PW­11 took the accused No.\n1, who was caught red­handed, in a Maruti car, followed the\nsaid  auto­rickshaw  to   the  aforesaid  hospital.  On  the  way,\nthey met PW­15 (Jagdish Shridhar Shetty), who identified the\ninjured and accompanied them to Mulund General Hospital.\n4. On arrival at the hospital, PW­11 handed over the custody of\naccused   No.   1,   along   with   his   blood­stained   chopper,   to\nGhanshyam Pawar for taking him to Mulund Police Station.\nOne important aspect is that all the while PW­11 stayed in\nthe  hospital   along  with   the   injured.   It   is   alleged   that   the\ndeceased said to have revealed to PW 11, the names of four\nassailants, Sunil Kashinath Chandanshiva (Accused No. 1),\n5\nAnil Gadekar (Accused No. 6), Vishnu Bule (Accused No. 5)\nand Sandeep Bhosale (Accused No. 4) and PW11 recorded the\nsame in his case diary.\n5. In the meanwhile, two police personnel (PW­24 and PW­25) of\nMulund Police Station, on receipt of the information of the\nincident from PW­11 and Ghanshyam Pawar, rushed to the\nMulund  General  Hospital  where,   they   came   to  know   that\nJagdish  Hingane  had  succumbed   to   the   injuries  at  about\n11:23 PM, and the other injured, PW­2 (Vitthal Hingane) was\nbeing taken to Sion Hospital for further treatment. With the\npermission of PW­23 (Dr. Anirrudh Gokhale), PW­24 recorded\nthe statement of the injured PW­2 at about 12:15 AM, and on\nthe basis of said statement PW 24 (PSI Joshi) registered the\noffence bearing C.R. No. 595 of 2006 against all the accused.\n6. Meanwhile   PW­24   seized   the   blood­stained   clothes   of   the\ninjured PW­2 (Vitthal Hingane) under panchanama (Ex. 27).\nThereafter,  PW­24 went to the spot along with PW­25 (PSI\nMane) and PW­11 and prepared spot panchanama (Ex. 29) in\nthe presence of the panch witness (PW­4). From the spot, the\nblood­stained mud was seized and photographs of the scene\nof the offence were taken. Then PW­24 returned to the Police\n6\nStation, made station diary entry and deposited muddemal in\nMalkhana. On the other hand, on the same night, at about 1\nA.M., PW­22 (PSI Shrikant Ramdas) seized the chopper and\nblood­stained clothes of Accused No. 1 under panchanama\n(Ex.­46) in the presence of the panch witness PW­10 (Raju\nJadhav). Accused No. 2 and 3 were also arrested on the same\nnight  of   the   incident.  Their   clothes  were  seized  by  PW­24\nunder  panchanama  (Ex.  34)   in   the  presence of   the  panch\nwitness PW­7 (Pradeep Shirodkar). At about 6:15 A.M., dead\nbody of the deceased was brought to Rajawadi Hospital Post\nMortem Centre and on examination, the deceased was found\nto have sustained 27 injuries.\n7. That   being   so,   on   13.12.2006  blood   stained   clothes   were\nseized from Accused No. 4 in the presence of panch witness\nPW­6 (Gopal Naidu). On 14.12.2006, Accused Nos. 5 and 6\nwere arrested and their blood stained clothes were seized in\nthe presence of PW­6. Scythe and sword were recovered from\nAccused No. 5 and 6 respectively (Ext. 40), in the presence of\npanch   witness   PW­8.   On   19.12.2006   PW­25   recorded\nsupplementary statement of PW­2.\n7\n8. After   completion  of   investigation,   charge­sheet  came   to  be\nfiled in the court against all the accused for various offences\nin the following manner­\nAll accused persons in the alleged crime are still\nin Magistrate custody since 20.12.2006. In order\nto submit charge­sheet against them in the court\nas   enough   evidence   is   available,   in   this   crime\nafter investigation section 120(b) of Indian Penal\nCode  and  Section  35  of   Indian  Arms Act  have\nbeen   removed   and   charge   sheet   is   prepared\nunder Section 143, 144, 147, 148, 149, 302, 307\nof Indian Penal Code with Sections 4, 25 and 27\nof Indian Arms Act and Sections 37(1)(a) and 135\nof Bombay Police Act. \n9. The Sessions Court framed charges against the accused in\nthe following manner­\nFirstly  :­  That   on   10/12/06   at   about   22:20   to\n22:30 hours at  ‘middle  gully’   from Goshala Road,\nSent   Payas   Road,   Madanmohan   Malviya   Cross\nRoad,   Mulund   (West),   Mumbai­400   080,   you\naccused were members of unlawful assembly with\nthe common object of which was of commit murder\nof   complainant   Vithal   Narayan   Hingane   and   his\nbrother Jagdish Hingane and thereby committed an\noffence  punishable  under  Section 143 of   IPC and\nwithin my cognizance.\nSecondly :­ That on the same date, time and place,\nyou accused being armed with deadly weapons with\nchopper, sickle, sword and knife were members of\nunlawful   assembly   and   thereby   committed   an\noffence  punishable  under  Section 144 of   IPC and\nwithin my cognizance.\n8\nThirdly  :­  That on the same date, time and place,\nyou accused were  members  of  unlawful  assembly\nand in prosecution of the common object of the said\nassembly namely to commit murder of complainant\nVithal  Narayan  Hingane   and  his   brother   Jagdish\nHingane  by  means  of   chopper,   sickle,   sword  and\nknife   which   offence   you   knew   to   be   likely   to   be\ncommitted in prosecution of the common object of\nthe said assembly and you being a member of such\nassembly   at   the   time   of   the   committing   of   that\noffence and thereby guilty of an offence punishable\nunder Section 149 of IPC and within my cognizance.",

He referred\nto the perceived benefits of “Body-Worn Cameras” in the United\nStates of America and the United Kingdom.  Body-worn cameras\n2\nact as deterrent against anti-social behaviour and is also a\ntool  to  collect  the  evidence.   It  was  submitted  that  new\ntechnological device for collection of evidence are order of\nthe day.  He also referred to the Field Officers' Handbook by\nthe  Narcotics  Control  Bureau,  Ministry  of  Home  Affairs,\nGovernment of India.  Reference was also made to Section 54-A\nof the Cr.P.C. providing for videography of the identification\nprocess and proviso to Section 164(1) Cr.P.C. providing for\naudio video recording of confession or statement under the\nsaid provision.\n(3) Thereafter, it was noted in the Order dated 12th October,\n2017,  that  the  matter  was  discussed  by  the  Union  Home\nSecretary with the Chief Secretaries of the States in which a\ndecision was taken to constitute a Committee of Experts (COE)\nto facilitate and prepare a road-map for use of videography in\nthe crime scene and to propose a Standard Operating Procedure\n(SOP).   However,  an  apprehension  was  expressed  about  its\nimplementation  on  account  of  scarcity  of  funds,  issues  of\nsecuring and storage of data and admissibility of evidence.\nWe noted the suggestion that still-photography may be useful\non  account  of  higher  resolution  for  forensic  analysis.\nDigital cameras can be placed on a mount on a tripod which may\nenable  rotation  and  tilting.   Secured  portals  may  be\nestablished  by  which  the  Investigation  Officer  can  e-mail\n3\nphotograph(s) taken at the crime scene.  Digital Images can be\nretained on State's server as permanent record.\nSLP(Crl.)NO.9431 of 2011:\n(1) Since identical question arose for consideration in this\nspecial leave petition as noted in Order dated 12th October,\n2017, we have heard learned amicus, Mr. Jayant Bhushan, senior\nadvocate, Ms. Meenakshi Arora, senior advocate, assisted by\nMs. Ananya Ghosh, Advocate, on the question of admissibility\nof electronic record.  We have also heard Mr. Yashank Adhyaru,\nlearned  senior  counsel,  and  Ms.  Shirin  Khajuria,  learned\ncounsel, appearing for Union of India.\n(2) An  apprehension  was  expressed  on  the  question  of\napplicability  of  conditions  under  Section  65B(4)  of  the\nEvidence Act to the effect that if a statement was given in\nevidence, a certificate was required in terms of the said\nprovision from a person occupying a responsible position in\nrelation to operation of the relevant device or the management\nof  relevant  activities.   It  was  submitted  that  if  the\nelectronic evidence was relevant and produced by a person who\nwas not in custody of the device from which the electronic\ndocument was generated, requirement of such certificate could\n4\nnot be mandatory.  It was submitted that Section 65B of the\nEvidence  Act  was  a  procedural  provision  to  prove  relevant\nadmissible evidence and was intended to supplement the law on\nthe point by declaring that any information in an electronic\nrecord, covered by the said provision, was to be deemed to be\na document and admissible in any proceedings without further\nproof of the original.  This provision could not be read in\nderogation of the existing law on admissibility of electronic\nevidence.\n(3) We have been taken through certain decisions which may be\nreferred to.  In Ram Singh and Others v. Col. Ram Singh, 1985\n(Supp) SCC 611, a Three-Judge Bench considered the said issue.\nEnglish Judgments in  R. v. Maqsud Ali, (1965) 2 All ER 464,\nand  R. v.  Robson, (1972) 2 ALL ER 699, and American Law as\nnoted in American Jurisprudence 2d (Vol.29) page 494, were\ncited with approval to the effect that it will be wrong to\ndeny to the law of evidence advantages to be gained by new\ntechniques  and  new  devices,  provided  the  accuracy  of  the\nrecording  can  be  proved.   Such  evidence  should  always  be\nregarded with some caution and assessed in the light of all\nthe circumstances of each case.  Electronic evidence was held\nto be admissible subject to safeguards adopted by the Court\nabout  the  authenticity  of  the  same.   In  the  case  of\n5\ntape-recording it was observed that voice of the speaker must\nbe duly identified, accuracy of the statement was required to\nbe proved by the maker of the record, possibility of tampering\nwas required to be ruled out.  Reliability of the piece of\nevidence is certainly a matter to be determined in the facts\nand circumstances of a fact situation.  However, threshold\nadmissibility of an electronic evidence cannot be ruled out on\nany technicality if the same was relevant.\n(4) In Tukaram S. Dighole v. Manikrao Shivaji Kokate, (2010)\n4 SCC 329, the same principle was reiterated.  This Court\nobserved that new techniques and devices are order of the day.\nThough  such  devices  are  susceptible  to  tampering,  no\nexhaustive rule could be laid down by which the admission of\nsuch  evidence  may  be  judged.   Standard  of  proof  of  its\nauthenticity and accuracy has to be more stringent than other\ndocumentary evidence.\n(5) In  Tomaso  Bruno  and  Anr. v.  State  of  Uttar  Pradesh,\n(2015)  7  SCC  178,  a  Three-Judge  Bench  observed  that\nadvancement of information technology and scientific temper\nmust pervade the method of investigation.  Electronic evidence\nwas relevant to establish facts.  Scientific and electronic\nevidence  can  be  a  great  help  to  an  investigating  agency.\n6\nReference was made to the decisions of this Court in  Mohd.\nAjmal Amir Kasab v. State of Maharashtra, (2012) 9 SCC 1 and\nState (NCT of Delhi) v. Navjot Sandhu, (2005) 11 SCC 600.\n(6) We may, however, also refer to judgment of this Court in\nAnvar P.V. v.  P.K. Basheer and Others, (2014) 10 SCC 473,\ndelivered by a Three-Judge Bench.  In the said judgment in\npara 24 it was observed that electronic evidence by way of\nprimary evidence was covered by Section 62 of the Evidence Act\nto which procedure of Section 65B of the Evidence Act was not\nadmissible. However, for the secondary evidence, procedure of\nSection 65B of the Evidence Act was required to be followed\nand  a  contrary  view  taken  in  Navjot  Sandh (supra)  that\nsecondary evidence of electronic record could be covered under\nSections  63  and  65  of  the  Evidence  Act,  was  not  correct.\nThere are, however, observations in para 14 to the effect that\nelectronic record can be proved only as per Section 65B of the\nEvidence Act.\n(7) Though in view of Three-Judge Bench judgments in  Tomaso\nBruno and  Ram  Singh (supra),  it  can  be  safely  held  that\nelectronic  evidence  is  admissible  and  provisions  under\nSections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act are by way of a\nclarification  and  are  procedural  provisions.   If  the\n7\nelectronic evidence is authentic and relevant the same can\ncertainly be admitted subject to the Court being satisfied\nabout its authenticity and procedure for its admissibility may\ndepend on fact situation such as whether the person producing\nsuch evidence is in a position to furnish certificate under\nSection 65B(h).\n(8) Sections 65A and 65B of the Evidence Act, 1872 cannot be\nheld to be a complete code on the subject.  In  Anvar P.V.\n(supra), this Court in para 24 clarified that primary evidence\nof electronic record was not covered under Sections 65A and\n65B of the Evidence Act.  Primary evidence is the document\nproduced before Court and the expression “document” is defined\nin Section 3 of the Evidence Act to mean any matter expressed\nor described upon any substance by means of letters, figures\nor marks, or by more than one of those means, intended to be\nused, or which may be used, for the purpose of recording that\nmatter.\n(9). The term “electronic record” is defined in Section 2(t)\nof the Information Technology Act, 2000 as follows:\n“Electronic record” means data, record or data\ngenerated,  image  or  sound  stored,  received  or\nsent  in  an  electronic  form  or  micro  film  or\ncomputer generated micro fiche.”\n8\n(10). Expression “data” is defined in Section 2(o) of the\nInformation Technology Act as follows.  \n“Data”  means  a  representation  of  information,\nknowledge, facts, concepts or instructions which\nare being prepared or have been prepared in a\nformalised  manner,  and  is  intended  to  be\nprocessed,  is  being  processed  or  has  been\nprocessed  in  a  computer  system  or  computer\nnetwork,  and  may  be  in  any  form  (including\ncomputer  printouts  magnetic  or  optical  storage\nmedia, punched cards, punched tapes) or stored\ninternally in the memory of the computer.”\n(11) The applicability of procedural requirement under Section\n65B(4) of the Evidence Act of furnishing certificate is to be\napplied only when such electronic evidence is produced by a\nperson who is in a position to produce such certificate being\nin control of the said device and not of the opposite party.\nIn a case where electronic evidence is produced by a party who\nis not in possession of a device, applicability of Sections 63\nand 65 of the Evidence Act cannot be held to be excluded.  In\nsuch case, procedure under the said Sections can certainly be\ninvoked.",

APPELLANT(S)\n                                VERSUS\nSTATE OF U.P. & ORS.                            RESPONDENT(S)\nJ U D G M E N T\nKURIAN, J.\nLeave granted.\n2. The  High  Court,  as  per  the  impugned  order,\ndeclined  to  grant  an  order  in  favour  of  the\nappellants for reference under Section 18 of the Land\nAcquisition  Act,  1894  (for  short  “the  Act”)  for\nenhancement of compensation, on the ground that the\napplication  was  filed  beyond  the  period  of  six\nmonths.  \n3. To  refer  to  the  undisputed  facts,  though  the\nAward was passed on 31.03.1999, the compensation was\npaid only on 07.04.1999.  There is no dispute that\nthe same was received under protest.  According to\nthe  appellants,  the  copy  of  the  Award  was  not\nsupplied  and,  therefore,  the  appellants  could  not\nfurnish the details of the objections with regard to\nthe Award in the application for reference.\n1\n4. Be that as it may, it is not in dispute that the\nappellants had filed an application for reference on\n24.07.1999.   To  the  extent  relevant,  the  request\nreads as follows:-\n“Kindly refer our case in the joint name\nof Shahid Jamal & Durwesh to reference court\nu/s. 18.  Also please refer the case Shahid\nJamal & M.A. Trading Co. and another in the\nname of Durwesh Najaf & MAT FAB International\nto reference court u/s. 18 and deposit the\naward amount u/s 31 sub section (2) part V.”\n5. It  seems  that  there  was  a  communication  dated\n25.09.1999 from the Land Acquisition Officer to the\nappellants.  The letter reads as follows:-\n“Please  accept  the  reference  of  your\nletter  dated  07.06.1999,  24.07.1999  and\n25.08.1999, under which it has been mentioned\nthat for the construction of the project of\nAhmadpur  Phulwaria  Phase-1  of  Bhadohi\nIndustrial  Development  Authority  the\ninformation of the declared Award regarding\nthe acquired land from the village Lakhanpur\nalias Abhayanpur has not been made available.\nRegarding this you have been informed that\nnotice  under  section  12(2)  was  sent  on\n31.03.1999 regarding declaring the Award, on\nwhich you refused to sign.  You demanded the\ncopy of the Award at the time of receiving\nthe amount of compensation on 07.04.1999 and\neven the photo copy of the Award was made\navailable  to  you,  but  on  the  receiving\nregister you did not sign, rather by making\n2\nunnecessary correspondence the certified copy\nof the Award is being demanded.  From your\nsaid act it seems that you are trying to take\nadvantage of the time limit (time barred) by\nhook or by crook after enclosing with your\napplication  the  judicial  precedents  of  the\nHon'ble Courts, which is improper.  Even then\naccording to your desire the so-called photo\ncopy of the Award is sent after enclosing.”\n6. It may be specifically noted that the said letter\ndated 25.09.1999 is, in any case, within six months’\nperiod, as required under Section 18(2) of the Act\n(as amended in the State of U.P.).\n7. Learned  senior counsel appearing for the State\npoints  out  that  a  proper  application  stating  the\ngrounds  for  reference  has  been  made  only  on\n30.12.1999, which is beyond the prescribed period of\nsix  months.   It  is  submitted  that  under  Section\n18(2), the application for reference should contain\nthe  grounds  for  reference  and,  therefore,  only  an\napplication with the grounds can be taken as a proper\napplication for reference.\n8. In the impugned judgment the High Court has taken\nnote of the fact that the appellants had come to know\nabout the Award on 07.04.1999 when the compensation\nwas  received  and  hence,  the  application  dated\n30.12.1999  under Section  18 of  the Act  was beyond\ntime and thus the writ petition was dismissed.\n3\n9.  Having  regard  to  the  factual  matrix  we  have\nreferred  to  above,  and  having  heard  the  learned\nsenior counsel appearing for the appellants as well\nas  the  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\nState, we find that the High Court has unfortunately\nmissed a crucial point on facts.  As can be seen from\nthe  extracted  portion  of  the  application  dated\n24.07.1999 there is a specific request for reference\nunder Section 18 of the Act.  It is not in dispute\nand it is borne out from the records also as seen by\nthe  High  Court  the  compensation  was  received  only\nunder protest  with regard to the sufficiency of the\ncompensation.  It is also seen from the communication\nfrom the Land Acquisition Officer to the appellants\ndated  25.09.1999,  on  which  date  the  time  under\nSection 18 had not expired, that certified copy of\nthe Award had not been furnished to the appellants.\nHowever, a photocopy of the Award was given, which\nthe appellants were not inclined to acknowledge.\n10. Having regard to the fact that the appellants had\naccepted the compensation under protest on the point\nof sufficiency of the compensation and having made a\nspecific request for reference under Section 18 on\n24.07.1999, which indisputably is within six months,\nwe are of the view that this is a case where the\nrequest  under  Section  18  of  the  Act  made  on\n24.07.1999 should be treated as a proper application.\n4\nIt may also have to be seen that before rejection the\ngrounds had also been furnished after receipt of the\ncertified copy of the Award.  Ordered accordingly.\n11. However, having regard to the peculiar facts and\ncircumstances of this case, we are of the view that\nwe should also invoke our jurisdiction under Article\n142  of the  Constitution of  India and  pass certain\nfurther orders for doing complete justice between the\nparties regarding the interest from 07.04.1999, the\ndate when the appellants received the compensation,\ntill  the filing  of this  special leave  petition on\n29.06.2012  in  the  interest  of  any  enhancement.\nAccordingly, for the said period, in the event of any\nenhancement, the appellants shall not be entitled to\nany interest.\n12. The appeal is disposed of, as above.\n13. Needless to say that this order is confined only\nto the statutory benefit of interest and all other\nbenefits, which the appellants are free to claim when\nthe  reference  under  Section  18  of  the  Act  is\nconsidered  on  merits.   We  also  direct  the  Land\nAcquisition Collector to make a reference within four\nweeks  from  today  and  the  Reference  Court  shall\ndispose of the same within three months thereafter.\nThe  parties  are  free  to  take  all  available\ncontentions before the Reference Court.\n5\n14. Pending  applications,  if  any,  shall  stand\ndisposed of.\n15. There shall be no orders as to costs.\n.........................J.\n              [KURIAN JOSEPH] \n.........................J.\n              [MOHAN M.

            "content":"1\n     \nREPORTABLE\nIN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA\nCIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION\nCIVIL APPEAL No.4189 OF 2007\nFlora Elias Nahoum & Ors. .... Appellants\nVersus\nIdrish Ali Laskar …. Respondent\nJ U D G M E N T\nAbhay Manohar Sapre, J.\n1. This appeal arises from the final judgment and\nfinal order/decree dated 07.07.2005 passed by the\nHigh  Court  of  Calcutta  in  F.A.  No.416  of  1984\nwhereby  the  Division  Bench  of  the  High  Court\ndismissed the eviction suit  filed by the appellants\nagainst the respondent and set aside the decree for\n2\neviction passed by the  Trial  Court  in their  favour\nand against the respondent. \n2. In order  to  appreciate  the  issues involved in\nthis appeal, it is necessary to set out the facts in\ndetail herein-below.\n3. The  appellants  are  the  plaintiffs  (landlords)\nwhereas the respondent is the defendant (tenant) in\nthe eviction suit out of which this appeal arises.\n4. The  appellants  (plaintiffs)  are  the\nowners/landlords  of  one  shop  (room)  bearing\npremises No.1, Hartford Lane, Calcutta (hereinafter\nreferred to as “the suit shop”), which was originally\nowned  by  Late  Nahoum  Elias  and  Miss  Resmah\nNahoum.  The  present  appellants  are  the\nsuccessors-in-interest of the suit shop. They had let\nout the suit shop to one - Alfajuddin Laskar on a\nmonthly  rent  of  Rs.40/-.   In  the  suit  shop,\n3\nAlfajuddin Laskar used to do the business of sale of\neggs under the name “24, Parganas Egg Stores”. \n5. Alfajuddin  Laskar  expired  in  1976.  The\nrespondent being his son became the tenant of the\nappellants  on  same  terms  and  conditions.  The\nrespondent, however, closed his father's business of\nselling  of  eggs  and  started  his  tailoring  business\nunder  the  name  “New  India  Tailors”  in  the  suit\nshop.\n6.   In 1978, the appellants filed an Eviction Suit\nagainst the respondent under the provisions of the\nWest  Bengal  Premises  Tenancy  Act,  1956\n(hereinafter  referred  to  as  “the  Act”.  The  eviction\nwas  claimed  on  four  grounds,  viz.,  default  in\npayment  of  monthly  rent,  bona  fide need,\nsub-letting  and  lastly,  making  of  unauthorized\nconstruction in the suit shop by the respondent.\n4\n7. The respondent filed the written statement and\ndenied all the four grounds. Parties adduced their\nevidence.  The  Trial  Court,  by  order  dated\n30.01.1984, partly decreed the suit. It was held that\nso far as the grounds relating to default of rent and\nbona fide need are concerned,  both are not made\nout  whereas  the  other  two  grounds,  namely,\nsub-letting  and  making  of  unauthorized\nconstruction in the suit shop, both stood made out\nagainst the respondent. \n8. In this view of matter, the appellants’ suit was\ndecreed  in  part  against  the  respondent  and  the\ndecree for eviction on the ground of sub-letting and\nunauthorized construction made by the respondent\nin the suit shop was passed. The respondent was\ngranted six  months’  time  to  vacate  the  suit  shop\nand  handover  its  vacant  possession  to  the\nappellants.\n5\n9. Being  aggrieved  by  the  said  order,  the\nrespondent  filed  appeal  before  the  High  Court  at\nCalcutta. The appellants, however, did not file any\ncross appeal or cross-objection against that part of\nthe  order  by  which  two  grounds,  viz.,  default  in\npayment of rent and  bona fide need were held not\nmade  out.  The  judgment  of  the  Trial  Court  thus\nbecame final to that extent.\n10.  Therefore, the only question before the High\nCourt was whether the Trial Court was justified in\ndecreeing  appellants’  suit  on  the  grounds  of\nsub-letting  and  making  of  unauthorized\nconstruction in the suit shop. \n11. In other words, the question was whether the\nTrial Court was right in holding that the ground of\nsub-letting  and  making  of  unauthorized\nconstruction in the suit shop was made out.\n6\n12. The  High  Court,  by  impugned  judgment,\nallowed the respondent’s appeal and dismissed the\nappellants’ eviction suit. The High Court held that\nno ground of either sub-letting or an unauthorized\nconstruction  was  made  out,  hence,  the  suit  was\nliable  to  be  dismissed  in  its  entirety.  It  was\naccordingly, dismissed.\n13. Against  this  judgment,  the  landlords  felt\naggrieved  and  filed  this  appeal  by  way  of  special\nleave in this Court. \n14. Heard Ms. Daisy Hannah, learned counsel for\nthe  appellants  and  Mr.  Zakiullah  Khan,  learned\nsenior counsel for the respondent.\n15. Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the\nparties and on perusal of the record of the case, we\nare inclined to allow the appeal and while  setting\naside of the impugned judgment, we restore that of\n7\nthe  Trial  Court  and,  in  consequence,  decree  the\nappellants’ suit in part, as indicated below.\n16. There  can  be  no  dispute  to  the  legal\nproposition that even if the landlord is able to make\nout only one ground out of several grounds of the\neviction,  he  is  entitled  to  seek the  eviction of  his\ntenant from the suit premises on the basis of that\nsole ground which he has made out under the Rent\nAct.  \n17. In  other  words,  it  is  not  necessary  for  the\nlandlord to make out all the grounds which he has\ntaken  in  the  plaint  for  claiming  eviction  of  the\ntenant under the Rent Act. If one ground of eviction\nis held made out against the tenant, that ground is\nsufficient to evict the tenant from the suit premises.\n18. As mentioned above, the Trial Court held that\nthe appellants were able to make out two grounds\nfor  respondent's  eviction,  namely,  sub-letting  and\n8\nunauthorized construction made by him in the suit\nshop.  The  High  Court,  accordingly,  reversed  the\nfindings on these  two grounds and dismissed the\nsuit.\n19. We  consider  it  proper  to  examine  first,  the\nground of sub-letting with a view to find out as to\nwhether the plaintiffs (appellants) were able to make\nout  this  ground  against  the  respondent.  In  other\nwords, let us first examine as to whether the Trial\nCourt was right or the High Court was right on this\nissue. \n20. In  order  to  examine,  whether  the  ground  of\nsub-letting is made out or not, it is necessary to see\nas to how this ground was pleaded and sought to be\nproved by the parties.    \n21. The appellants, in Para 4 of the plaint, pleaded\nthe case of sub-letting as under:\n“4. The  defendant  after  acquiring\nright of tenancy in respect of the said shop\n9\nroom  after  his  father’s  death,  wrongfully\ntransferred possession of the said shop room\nto one Joynal Mallick evidently for creating a\nsub-tenant in his favour in respect of the suit\nshop room without obtaining the permission\nand consent of the plaintiffs.”\n22. The  respondent,  in  reply  to  Para  4  of  the\nplaint,  gave  the  following  reply  in  Para  9  of  his\nwritten statement as under:\n“9. The  defendant  denies  the\nallegations made in paragraph 4 of the plaint\nand in particular denies the allegations that\nhe  has  transferred  possession  of  the  shop\nunder his tenancy to one Joynal Mullick or\nanybody as falsely alleged.”\n23. It  is  clear  from the  perusal  of  the  pleadings\nthat  the  case  of  the  appellants  was  that  the\nrespondent has sub-let and parted with possession\nof  the  suit  shop  to  one  Joynal  Mullick  without\nappellants’ consent.\n24.  So  far  as  the  respondent  is  concerned,  he\nsimply denied the appellants’ case in para 9 saying\nthat  he  has  not  sub-let  the  suit  shop to  anyone,\n10\nmuch  less  to  Joynal  Mullick,  as  claimed  by  the\nappellants.\n25.  The respondent examined himself as witness\nNo.1 and examined Joynal Mullick as witness No.2.\n26. In  examination-in-chief,  the  respondent\nchanged his stand and said that he has not sub-let\nthe  suit  shop to  Joynal  Mullick  but  he  is  in  his\nemployment. This is what he said:\n“It is not a fact that I sublet the shop room\nin suit to one Jainal Mullick.  Jainal Mullick\nis in my employment.”\n27. The  respondent  further  in  his\ncross-examination again changed his stand and in\nanswer  to  a  specific  question  put  to  him  as  to\nwhether he has employed any person in his tailoring\nbusiness said \"no\". This was his reply:-\n“No.    In  the  tailoring  business  I  have  no\nemployee but the work is done on contract\nbasis.”\n11\n28. The  respondent  then  in  answer  to  another\nquestion put to him as to how many persons work\nfor you on contract basis in his tailoring business,\nhis reply was- four persons and out of four,  Joynal\nMullick and Jahangir Mullick were his employees.\nThis is what he said:-\n“Najrul Islam and Sayed, Volunteers – Besides\nthese  persons  there  are  two  other  persons\nwho look after the business in my absence.\nThey are Jainal Mullick and Zahangir Mullick\nvolunteers.",

This  appeal  is  directed  against  the  final\njudgment  and  order  dated  21.09.2006  passed  by\nthe High Court of Kolkata in C.O. No.1759 of 2006\nwhereby the High Court allowed the application filed\nby  respondent  No.1  herein  and  reversed  the\njudgment  and  order  dated  15.12.2005  passed  by\nthe  Judge,  Small  Causes  Court,  Kolkata  in\nEjectment Suit No.1615 of 2000 wherein the Trial\nCourt dismissed the application filed by respondent\nNo.1 herein under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the Code of\n2\nCivil Procedure, 1908 (hereinafter referred to as “the\nCode”) for impleadment as Plaintiff in the pending\nejectment suit.  \n2. The controversy involved in this appeal is short\nand it  would be  clear  from the  few relevant facts\nmentioned hereinbelow.\n3. The  appellants  are  the  plaintiffs  whereas\nrespondent  Nos.  2 to  5  are  the  defendants  in  an\nEjectment Suit out of which this appeal arises. \n4. The appellants have filed a suit for ejectment\nbeing  Ejectment  Suit  No.1615/2000  against\nrespondent  Nos.  2  to  5  before  the  Small  Causes\nCourt at Calcutta for their eviction on the grounds\nof  non-payment of  rent,  subletting,  and  bona fide\nneed  of  the  suit  premises  for  their  personal  use\nunder  the  provisions of  the  West  Bengal  Tenancy\nAct.  Respondent  Nos.  2  to  5  have  entered\nappearance  and  are  contesting  the  suit  which  is\npending.  \n3\n5. In the Ejectment Suit, respondent No. 1 herein\nfiled an application under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the\nCode  praying  therein  that  he  may  be  allowed  to\nbecome the  co-plaintiff  along  with  the  appellants.\nRespondent No. 1 sought his impleadment alleging\nthat he is a member of the appellants’ family and\nbeing so, has a right, title and interest not only in\nthe suit premises but also in other family properties\nas one of the co-owners. It is essentially on these\nallegations and with a view to protect his interest in\nthe  suit  premises,  respondent  No.  1  sought  his\nimpleadment in the suit. \n6. The said application for impleadment made by\nrespondent No. 1 was dismissed by the Trial Court\nby  order  15.12.2005(Annexure-P-7)  but  it  was\nallowed by the High Court by the impugned order\ngiving rise to filing of this appeal by way of special\nleave  in  this  Court  against  the  order  of  the  High\nCourt by the appellants (plaintiffs).\n4\n7. Therefore, the short question, which arises for\nconsideration in this  appeal,  is  whether  the  High\nCourt was justified in allowing the application filed\nby respondent No. 1 under Order 1 Rule 10 (2) of\nthe  Code  thereby  permitting  him  to  become\nco-plaintiff  in  the  Ejectment  Suit  filed  by  the\nappellants against respondent Nos. 2 to 5 for their\neviction from the suit premises. \n8. Heard Mr. Ranjan Mukherjee, learned counsel\nfor  the  appellants  and  respondent  No.1,  who\nappeared in-person.\n9. Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the\nappellants  and  respondent  No.  1,  in-person,  who\nalone  is  the  contesting  respondent  in  this  appeal\nand on perusal  of  the  record of  the  case,  we are\ninclined to allow the appeal and while setting aside\nthe impugned order of the High Court, restore the\norder  of  the  Trial  Court  with  observations\nhereinbelow. \n5\n10. In other words, we are inclined to dismiss the\napplication filed by respondent No. 1 under Order 1\nRule 10(2) of the Code in appellants’ ejectment suit.\n11. There  are  some well-settled principles  of  law\non the question involved in this appeal, which need\nto  be  taken into  consideration while  deciding  the\nquestion arose in this appeal.  These principles are\nmentioned infra.\n12. First, in an eviction suit filed by the plaintiff\n(Landlord) against the defendant(Tenant) under the\nState Rent Act, the landlord and tenant are the only\nnecessary parties. \n13. In  other  words,  in  a  tenancy  suit,  only  two\npersons are necessary parties for the decision of the\nsuit, namely, the landlord and the tenant. \n14. Second, the landlord (plaintiff) in such suit is\nrequired  to  plead  and  prove  only  two  things  to\nenable him to claim a decree for eviction against his\ntenant from the tenanted suit premises. First, there\nexists  a  relationship  of  the  landlord  and  tenant\n6\nbetween the plaintiff and the defendant and second,\nthe  ground(s)  on  which  the  plaintiff-landlord  has\nsought defendant’s-tenant's eviction under the Rent\nAct  exists.   When  these  two  things  are  proved,\neviction suit succeeds.\n15. Third, the question of title to the suit premises\nis not germane for the decision of the eviction suit.\nThe reason being, if the landlord fails to prove his\ntitle to the suit premises but proves the existence of\nrelationship of the landlord and tenant in relation to\nthe  suit  premises  and further  proves  existence  of\nany ground on which the eviction is sought under\nthe Tenancy Act, the eviction suit succeeds. \n16.  Conversely, if the landlord proves his title to\nthe suit premises but fails to prove the existence of\nrelationship of the landlord and tenant in relation to\nthe  suit  premises,  the  eviction suit  fails.  (See-Dr.\nRanbir Singh  vs. Asharfi Lal, 1995(6) SCC 580).   \n17. Fourth,  the  plaintiff  being  a  dominus  litis\ncannot  be  compelled  to  make  any third  person a\n7\nparty to the suit, be that a plaintiff or the defendant,\nagainst his wish unless such person is able to prove\nthat he is a necessary party to the suit and without\nhis presence, the suit cannot proceed and nor can\nbe decided effectively. \n18. In  other  words,  no  person  can  compel  the\nplaintiff  to  allow  such  person  to  become  the\nco-plaintiff or defendant in the suit.  It is more so\nwhen such person is unable to show as to how he is\na  necessary  or  proper  party  to  the  suit  and  how\nwithout his presence, the suit can neither proceed\nand nor it can be decided or how his presence is\nnecessary  for  the  effective  decision  of  the  suit.\n(See-Ruma Chakraborty vs. Sudha Rani Banerjee\n& Anr., 2005(8) SCC 140) \n19.  Fifth, a necessary party is one without whom,\nno order can be made effectively, a proper party is\none  in  whose  absence  an  effective  order  can  be\nmade  but  whose  presence  is  necessary  for  a\ncomplete and final decision on the question involved\n8\nin  the  proceeding.  (See-Udit  Narain  Singh\nMalpaharia  vs.  Additional  Member  Board  of\nRevenue, Bihar & Anr., AIR 1963 786)  \n20. Sixth, if there are co-owners or co-landlords of\nthe suit premises then any co-owner or co-landlord\ncan file  a  suit  for  eviction  against  the  tenant.  In\nother  words,  it  is  not  necessary  that  all  the\nowners/landlords should join in filing the eviction\nsuit  against  the  tenant.  (See-Kasthuri\nRadhakrishnan & Ors. vs. M. Chinniyan & Anr.,\n2016(3) SCC 296)\n21. Keeping  in  mind  the  aforementioned  well\nsettled  principles  of  law  and  on  examining  the\nlegality  of  the  impugned  order,  we  find  that  the\nimpugned order is not legally sustainable and hence\ndeserves to be set aside.\n22. In our considered opinion, respondent No. 1,\nwho  claims  to  be  the  co-sharer  or/and  co-owner\nwith  the  plaintiffs  (appellants  herein)  of  the  suit\nproperty  is  neither  a  necessary  and nor  a  proper\n9\nparty in the eviction suit of the appellants against\nrespondent  Nos.  2  to  5.  In  other  words,  such\neviction suit can be decreed or dismissed on merits\neven without the impleadment of respondent No.1.\n23. In the eviction suit, the question of title or the\nextent  of  the  shares  held  by  the  appellants  and\nrespondent  No.  1  against  each  other  in  the  suit\npremises cannot be decided and nor can be made\nthe subject matter for its determination. \n24. The  reason  being  that  this  is  not  a  suit\nbetween the  appellants  (plaintiffs)  and respondent\nNo.1 where their  inter se rights relating to the suit\npremises  can  be  gone  into  but  rather  is  an\nejectment  suit  filed  by  the  appellants  against\nrespondent Nos. 2 to 5 for their eviction from the\nsuit premises.\n25.  Therefore, the  Lis in the suit is between the\nappellants on the one hand and respondent Nos. 2\nto 5 on the other hand and the decision in the suit\nwould  depend  upon  the  question  as  to  whether\n10\nthere exists any relationship of landlord and tenant\nbetween the appellants and respondent Nos. 2 to 5\nin relation to the suit premises and, if so, whether\nthe  grounds  pleaded  in  the  plaint  for  claiming\neviction of respondent Nos. 2 to 5 are established or\nnot.  For  deciding  these  two  main  questions,  the\npresence of respondent No. 1 is not necessary. \n26. For  these  reasons,  we  are  of  the  considered\nopinion that respondent No. 1 is neither a necessary\nand nor a proper party in the suit.\n27. We,  however,  make  it  clear  that  any  finding\nwhether  directly  or  indirectly,  if  recorded  by  the\nTrial Court touching the question of title over the\nsuit property, would not be binding on respondent\nNo.1  regardless  of  the  outcome  of  the  suit  and\nrespondent  No.  1  would  be  free  to  file  an\nindependent civil  suit against the appellants for a\ndeclaration of his right, title and interest in the suit\npremises  and  in  any  other  properties,  if  so,  and\n11\nclaim partition and separate possession of his share\nby metes and bounds in all such properties. \n28. In view of the foregoing discussion, the appeal\nsucceeds and is allowed. The impugned order is set\naside and the order of the Trial Court is restored. \n29. As  a  consequence,  the  application  filed  by\nrespondent No. 1 under Order 1 Rule 10(2) of the\nCode  in  the  aforementioned  ejectment  suit  is\ndismissed.\n30. The  Trial  Court  is  directed  to  decide  the\nejectment  suit  on  merits  in  accordance  with  law\nexpeditiously.\n                  \n………...................................J.\n  [R. K.

Anusuiya @ Saraswatibai\n& Anr.            ….Appellant(s)\nVERSUS\nState of Madhya Pradesh    ….Respondent(s)\n                 \nJ U D G M E N T\nAbhay Manohar Sapre, J.\n1) This   appeal  is  filed  by  the  two  accused\npersons against the final judgment and order dated\n14.02.2007 passed  by  the  High Court  of  Madhya\nPradesh at Jabalpur in Criminal Appeal No. 419 of\n1992  whereby  the  High  Court  partly  allowed  the\nappeal  and  while  upholding  the  judgment  dated\n02.04.1992 passed by the First Additional Sessions\nJudge,  Chhindwara  in  Sessions  Trial  No.3/91\n2\nconvicting  the  appellants-accused  under  Sections\n306  and  498A   of  the  Indian  Penal  Code,  1908\n(hereinafter referred to as “IPC”) reduced the period\nof  their  sentence  awarded under  Section 306 IPC\nfrom  Seven  years  to  five  years  and  a  fine  of\nRs.1000/-  each,  in  default  of  payment  of  fine,  to\nfurther  undergo  RI  for  three  months  and  under\nSection 498A, from three years to two years.  Both\nthe sentences to run concurrently.\n2) Brief facts:\nThe  case  of  the  prosecution  is  that  the\nmarriage  of  Rekhabai(deceased)  and\nChandrashekhar (appellant No.2) was performed on\n12.05.1989,  six  months  prior  to  her  death.\nAppellant No.1 is the mother-in-law of the deceased.\n3) On 21.11.1989, a Marg Report was recorded at\nChandameta  Police  Station  that  Rekhabai  was\nbrought  dead  in  W.C.L.  Hospital  Bandkuhee  by\n3\nGajanand.   After  preparing  the  inquest\npanchanama(Ex.P/8),  the  dead body was sent  for\npost mortem.  Dr. R.K. Basor(PW-8) performed the\npost  mortem and submitted  the  report  (Ex.P/10).\nAccording to PW-8, the death of Rekhabai was quite\nunnatural. Thereafter the viscera collected from the\ndead body was sent to Forensic Science Laboratory\nfor Chemical examination.  \n3) On  25.11.1989,  Saligram  (PW-1),  father  of\nRekhabai(deceased),  submitted a  written report  to\nthe police station, Chhindwara mentioning therein\nthat  her daughter had committed suicide because\nher  in-laws  were  harassing  her  for  not  bringing\ndowry  in  marriage  and  demanding  one  Fan  and\nRs.500/- from her parents.  He further said that on\n19.11.1989, one day before the death of Rekhabai,\nhis daughter and son-in-law came to his house and\nstayed there for the night and on the next morning,\n4\nhis son-in-law again demanded a Fan and Rs.500/-\nfrom  him  and  on  not  being  given  the  same,  he\nstarted  quarreling  and  went  away  saying  that\nconsequence would be heard of the next day.  On\nthe next day, when Rekhabai suddenly became ill,\nSurendra  Pathak(CW-1)  examined  her  on  the\nrequest of Chandrashekhar and advised him to take\nher  to  the  Hospital.   On  the  way  to  Hospital,\nRekhabai died.    \n4) On 30.03.1990, report of the Forensic Science\nLaboratory was received mentioning therein that the\ndeath  of  Rekhabai  was  caused  by  consuming  rat\npoison.  \n5) After investigation, charge sheet was filed and\nby order dated 29.12.1990, the case was committed\nto  the  Court  of  Sessions.   The  accused\npersons(appellants) denied the charges.  \n5\n6) By  judgment  dated  02.04.1992,  the  First\nAdditional  Sessions  Judge,  Chhindwara  convicted\nthe  appellants  for  the  offences  punishable  under\nSections 306 and 498A IPC and sentenced both of\nthem  under  Section  306  to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment  of  seven  years  and  a  fine  of\nRs.1000/- each and in default of payment of fine, to\nundergo  further  rigorous  imprisonment  for  six\nmonths. So far as the sentence under Section 498A\nwas concerned, both the appellants were sentenced\nto undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years.\nThe sentences were to run consecutively.\n7) Challenging the judgment of  the  Trial  Court,\nthe appellants (accused) filed appeal before the High\nCourt.\n8) The High Court, by impugned judgment dated\n14.02.2007, partly allowed the appeal,  upheld the\nconviction but modified the sentence awarded to the\n6\nappellants under Section 306 from Seven years to\nfive years and a fine of Rs.1000/- each, in default,\nto further undergo RI for three months and so far as\nsentence under Section 498A was concerned, it was\nmodified from three years to two years.  Both the\nsentences were to run concurrently.\n9) Against  the judgment of  the High Court,  the\nappellants (accused) have filed this appeal by way of\nspecial leave before this Court. \n 10) Heard Mr.Pradeep Misra,  learned counsel  for\nthe appellants and Mr. B.N. Dubey, learned counsel\nfor the respondent.\n11) Having  heard  the  learned  counsel  for  the\nparties  and on perusal  of  the  record of  the  case,\nthough we uphold the conviction of the appellants\nunder both the Sections, namely, Section 306 and\nSection 498  IPC, but having regard to the peculiar\nfacts  and  circumstances  of  the  case  as  set  out\n7\nhereinbelow,  modify  the  sentence  and accordingly\nreduce the period of sentence of both the appellants\nas indicted below.\n12) We have perused the evidence with a view to\nfind out as to whether the prosecution was able to\nprove their case under the twin Sections, namely,\nSections 306 and 498-A of the IPC, which resulted\nin death of  Rekhabai  and,  if  so,  whether  the two\nCourts below were justified in convicting both the\nappellants and awarding to them the sentence as\ndetailed above.\n13)  Having  gone  through  the  evidence  and\nexamining the findings of the two Courts on all the\nmaterial issues involved in the case, we are of the\nconsidered opinion that no fault can be found in the\nmanner in which both the Courts below appreciated\nthe evidence so also no fault can be found in their\n8\nrespective  reasoning  which  resulted  in  convicting\nthe appellants. \n14) It is a settled principle of law that if there is no\nperversity  noticed  in  the  findings  of  the  Courts\nbelow and more  so when the  findings  of  the  two\nCourt below are of concurrence then such findings\nwould be binding on this Court while hearing the\nappeal under Article 136 of the Constitution. Such\nis the case here.\n15) It is not in dispute that Rekhabai died within\nsix months from the date of her marriage. The date\nof  marriage  is  12.05.1989  whereas  the  death\noccurred on 21.11.1989.  It  is  not  in  dispute  that\nRekhabai died due to consuming the poison. It  is\nalso  not  in  dispute  that  the  two  Courts,  on\nappreciating  the  evidence,  recorded  a  categorical\nfinding that  appellant No. 1, mother-in-law and the\nhusband  (appellant  No.  2)  had  demanded  dowry\n9\nfrom the parents of the  deceased and when they\ndid  not  accede  to  the  dowry  demand,  appellant\nNo.2-  husband  threatened  the  father  of  the\ndeceased  and  deceased  herself  of  the  dire\nconsequences  for  not  acceding  to  his  demand  of\ndowry. \n16) It  has  also  come  in  the  evidence  of  the\ndeceased's father (PW-1), which found acceptance to\nthe two Courts and, in our opinion, rightly that the\nappellants  used  to  beat  the  deceased  soon  after\ntheir marriage till her death.\n17)  In the light of the aforementioned findings of\nthe two Courts below to which we concur, a case\nunder  Section  306  and   Section  498-A  IPC  was\nrightly  held  made  out  against  appellant  No.  1-\nmother-in-law and appellant No. 2-husband. \n18) Indeed  when  an  unnatural  death  of  the\nmarried woman takes place within seven years of\n10\nher marriage then a presumption, as envisaged in\nSection 113-A of the Evidence Act,1972 against the\nhusband and his relatives is made out. In this case,\nthe  same  was  duly  made  out  with  the  aid  of\nevidence  adduced  against  the  appellants.   The\nappellants, however, in their defense failed to rebut\nthe  presumption  and  whatever  evidence  they\nadduced  in  defense  was  not  held  enough to  give\nthem the benefit of doubt or clean acquittal.\n19) We,  therefore,  uphold  the  conviction  of  both\nthe appellants under Section 306 and Section 498-A\nof IPC  \n20) This takes us to the next question about the\naward of sentence to the appellants under both the\nSections.  We may state here that there is no appeal\nfiled by the State for enhancement of the period of\nsentence.",
