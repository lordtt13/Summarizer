A question much debated in the High Courts is posed in this reference under s. 256(1) of the I.T.\nAct, 1961. What, principally, is to be determined is whether the whether the words "regular\nassessment" is s. 214(1) of the I.T. Act, 1961, mean the order of regular assessment passed by the\nITO or the last operative order of regular assessment at any given point of time passed as a result of\nappellate or revisional proceedings. If the answer is that "regular assessment" means only the first\norder of regular assessment passed by the ITO, the Central Government would be liable to pay to the\nassessee interest on the amount by which the advance tax paid by him during any financial year\nexceeds the amount of tax determined upon such first order of regular assessment from 1st April,\nnext following the said financial year to the date of such first order of regular assessment. If the\nanswer is that "regular assessment" means the last operative order of regular assessment, the\nCentral Government would be liable to pay to the assessee interest on the amount by which the\nadvance tax paid by him during any financial year exceeds the amount of tax determined upon such\nlast operative order of regular assessment from 1st April next following the said financial year to the\ndate of such last operative order of regular assessment.', "Hon'ble Devi Prasad Singh,J.", 'Hon.

A question much debated in the High Courts is posed in this reference under s. 256(1) of the I.T.\nAct, 1961. What, principally, is to be determined is whether the whether the words "regular\nassessment" is s. 214(1) of the I.T. Act, 1961, mean the order of regular assessment passed by the\nITO or the last operative order of regular assessment at any given point of time passed as a result of\nappellate or revisional proceedings. If the answer is that "regular assessment" means only the first\norder of regular assessment passed by the ITO, the Central Government would be liable to pay to the\nassessee interest on the amount by which the advance tax paid by him during any financial year\nexceeds the amount of tax determined upon such first order of regular assessment from 1st April,\nnext following the said financial year to the date of such first order of regular assessment. If the\nanswer is that "regular assessment" means the last operative order of regular assessment, the\nCentral Government would be liable to pay to the assessee interest on the amount by which the\nadvance tax paid by him during any financial year exceeds the amount of tax determined upon such\nlast operative order of regular assessment from 1st April next following the said financial year to the\ndate of such last operative order of regular assessment.', '19,900.
